a,I could not sleep I thought of the occurrences of the day What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and I longed to join them but dared not I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun The young woman arranged the cottage and

a,heard These are the reflections of the first days but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished My mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to
a,never again to rise Must I then lose this admirable being I have longed for a friend I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me Behold on these desert seas I have found such a one but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him I would reconcile him to life but he repulses the idea I thank you Walton he said for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone

a,dispositions I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity Could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship I resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate I postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail Besides I found that my understanding improved so much with every days
a,in a degree almost too severe to support The peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hidingplaces to seek for prey The rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours One inscription that he left was in these words Prepare Your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we

a,integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him A youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that I can not overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship I have never believed it to be necessary and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services I heard of him first

a,burst from his heaving breast I paused at length he spoke in broken accents Unhappy man Do you share my madness Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught Hear me let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips Such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure Having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion

b,you have added so much to it yourselfyou are always buying books I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these Neglect I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place Charles when you build your house I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley I wish it may But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take Pemberley for a kind of model There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire With all my heart I
b,been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once No aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoeroses for Netherfield were got by proxy Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr Wickham and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia
b,business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else Nay cried Bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning And yet upon my honour I believed what I said of myself to be true and I believe it at this moment At least therefore I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies I daresay you believed it but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity Your conduct would be
b,the company By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain Mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song Elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for Mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half
b,harm to be off You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham What a good joke it will be I can hardly write for laughing Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure I shall
b,compliment to Darcy Caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease He studies too much for words of four syllables Do not you Darcy My style of writing is very different from yours Oh cried Miss Bingley Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable He leaves out half his words and blots the rest My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents Your humility Mr Bingley said Elizabeth must disarm reproof Nothing is more deceitful said Darcy
b,than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry Mr Wickham began to speak on more general topics Meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry It was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire I know it to be a most respectable agreeable
b,Darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much Mrs Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized
b,so assiduously courted you ThereI have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered I begin to think it perfectly reasonable To be sure you know no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield Dearest Jane who could have done less for her But make a virtue of it by all means My good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it
b,always so Those who do not complain are never pitied Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation She talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr Collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls Now I do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let Mr Collins and me have a little conversation together Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room
b,shall spend And when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything We will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen Lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers Illustration At the door CHAPTER XXVIII Illustration Every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth
b,always affronted by their advice and Lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing They were ignorant idle and vain While there was an officer in Meryton they would flirt with him and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn they would be going there for ever Anxiety on Janes behalf was another prevailing concern and Mr Darcys explanation by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what Jane had lost His affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the
b,I think than last year His attachment to Rosings certainly increases Mr Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter Lady Catherine observed after dinner that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added But if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer Mrs Collins will be very glad of your company I am sure I
b,up with somebody else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room He assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening There was no arguing upon such a project She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged Mr Collinss conversation to herself She was at least free from the offence of Mr Darcys further
b,heard from my uncle Yes I have had a letter from him by express Well and what news does it bringgood or bad What is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand Jane now came up Read it aloud said their father for I hardly know myself what it is about RIGHT Gracechurch Street Monday August 2 My dear Brother At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the
b,of woe How can you be smiling so Lizzy Their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty years ago I am sure said she I cried for two days together when Colonel Millers regiment went away I thought I should have broke my heart I am sure I shall break mine said Lydia If one could but go to Brighton observed Mrs Bennet Oh yesif one could but go to Brighton But papa is so disagreeable A little seabathing would set me up for ever And my aunt Philips
b,Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea and Mrs Collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power In her kind schemes for Elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but
b,Miss Elizabeth Bennet Miss Elizabeth Bennet repeated Miss Bingley I am all astonishment How long has she been such a favourite and pray when am I to wish you joy That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask A ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment I knew you would be wishing me joy Nay if you are so serious about it I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled You will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at Pemberley
b,that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged You have widely mistaken my character if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs I can not tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine I must beg therefore to be importuned no further on the subject Not so hasty if you please I have by no means done To all the objections I have already urged I have
b,ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite In this danger Kitty is also comprehended She will follow wherever Lydia leads Vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled Oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace Mr Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply Do not make yourself uneasy my love Wherever you and Jane are known you
b,he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living His former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them There was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him And in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left
b,up as to believe him capable of it Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest But of every other neglect I can believe him capable If indeed it should be so But I dare not hope it Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case In the first place replied Mr Gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland Oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption And besides no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road Well
b,was a welcome relief to him at Rosings and Mrs Collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much He now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself as well as of Mr Darcy His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her
b,never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking Nobody can tell what I suffer But it is always so Those who do not complain are never pitied Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation She talked on therefore without interruption from
b,a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham He has not an illnatured look On the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart But to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes But he is a liberal master I suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue Elizabeth here felt herself called
b,was over glad to invite him Illustration Protested that he never read novels HT Feb 94 to read aloud to the ladies Mr Collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels Kitty stared at him and Lydia exclaimed Other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons Lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with Do you
b,that must intervene before their invitation could be senthopeless of seeing him before But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy Jane resolutely kept her place at the table but Elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw Mr Darcy with him and sat down again by her sister There is a gentleman with him mamma said Kitty who can it be Some acquaintance or other my dear I suppose
b,for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up Goodbye Give my love to Colonel Forster I hope you will drink to our good journey Your affectionate friend LYDIA BENNET Oh thoughtless thoughtless Lydia cried Elizabeth when
b,sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations They could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same Lydias going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydias leaving home Elizabeth was now to see Mr Wickham for the last time Having been frequently in company with him since her
b,ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received He was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex But while he was mortal there must be a triumph She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her His understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and
b,receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire As for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin Elizabeth With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return Mrs Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and Mary
b,for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err But when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of Wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate She put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success On both sides it was only assertion Again she read on But every line proved more clearly that the affair which she
b,her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs Collins she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to Mrs Collins
b,to him But I ought to beg his pardon for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant It was all conjecture What is it you mean It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing You may depend upon my not mentioning it And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley What he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved
b,generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing You may depend upon my not mentioning it And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley What he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from
b,performed delightfully How does Georgiana get on Darcy Mr Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency I am very glad to hear such a good account of her said Lady Catherine and pray tell her from me that she can not expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal I assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice She practises very constantly So much the better It can not be done too much and when I next write to her I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account
b,her Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her Ladyships indignation would have been What would she have said how would she have behaved were the questions with which she amused herself Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party I assure you I feel it exceedingly said Lady Catherine I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do But I am particularly attached to
b,the sister of Jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge therefore for through their communication with the Collinses the report she concluded had reached Lady Catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time In revolving Lady Catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness
b,elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which Elizabeth considered as all but certain and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard Give me further particulars What did Colonel Forster say Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
b,welfare of his friend Elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as Miss Bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to Wickham Georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more Her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while Mr Darcy was attending them
b,with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart Mr Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs Gardiner and Miss Bennet to dinner at Pemberley before they left the country Miss Darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed Mrs Gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but Elizabeth had turned away her head Presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary
b,longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying There are very few people of whom so much can be said You are lucky in having such a master Yes sir I know I am If I were to go through the world I could not meet with a better But I have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generoushearted boy in the world Elizabeth almost stared at her Can this be Mr Darcy thought she His father was an
b,answer for it he never cared three straws about her Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing Elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal As soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of Kittys and Lydias purchases were seated in it How nicely we are crammed in cried
b,their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character This information however startled Mrs Bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so But depend upon it Mr Collins she added that Lizzy shall be brought to reason I will speak to her
b,to do Nothing child nothing I did not wink at you She then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to Kitty Come here my love I want to speak to you took her out of the room Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that she would not give in to it In a few minutes Mrs Bennet half opened the door and called out Lizzy my dear I want to speak with you Elizabeth was forced
b,feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydias marriage All was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation Good gracious cried Mrs Bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable Mr Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here I had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company What shall we
b,me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time Mr Bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them Mrs Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of
b,a young Lucas who came with his sisters I should not care how proud I was I would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said Mrs Bennet and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly The boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit Illustration Illustration CHAPTER VI Illustration The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield The visit
b,their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement Catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under Lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and Lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing They were ignorant idle and vain While there was an officer in Meryton they would flirt with him and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn they would be going there for ever Anxiety on Janes behalf was another prevailing concern and Mr Darcys explanation by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what Jane had lost His
b,chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenour of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of Mr Collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings A lively imagination soon settled it all About the middle of the next
b,by him at Lucas Lodge and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed Illustration Whenever she spoke in a low voice Mrs Bennet was really in a most pitiable state The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her As her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded
b,formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlottes dying an old maid Charlotte herself was tolerably composed She had gained her point and had time to consider of it Her reflections were in general satisfactory Mr Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary But still he would be her husband Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the
b,for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin To oblige you I would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart My dear Jane Mr Collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as I do and you must feel as well as I do that the woman who marries him
b,London where a lady lives with her and superintends her education After many pauses and many trials of other subjects Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr Bingley How can Mr Bingley who seems goodhumour itself and is I really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man How can they suit each other Do you know Mr Bingley Not at all He is a sweettempered amiable charming man He can not know what Mr Darcy is Probably not but Mr Darcy can please where
b,to lead you to the altar ere long Upon my word sir cried Elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time I am perfectly serious in my refusal You could not make me happy and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so Nay were your friend Lady Catherine to know
b,highest opinion In understanding Darcy was the superior Bingley was by no means deficient but Darcy was clever He was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared Darcy was continually giving offence The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality
b,was fixed for the following Tuesday The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation To the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding Mrs Bennet as much as possible saying not much to Elizabeth and nothing at all to the others They were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs Bennets civilities The prospect of
b,observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent Do you talk by rule then while you are dancing Sometimes One must speak a little you know It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine Both replied Elizabeth archly for I have always
b,all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs Bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property The dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing But here he was set right by Mrs Bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen He begged pardon
b,many pretty things He is as fine a fellow said Mr Bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever I saw He simpers and smirks and makes love to us all I am prodigiously proud of him I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw The loss of her daughter made Mrs Bennet very dull for several days I often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends One seems so forlorn without them This is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter
b,in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all I have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with Thank God I have not that pain A little time thereforeI shall certainly try to get the better With a stronger voice she soon added I have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself My dear Jane exclaimed Elizabeth you are too good Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic
b,and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable Mr Bennet could not have chosen better Mr Collins was eloquent in her praise The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings and
b,suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady And what arts did he use to separate them He did not talk to me of his own arts said Fitzwilliam smiling He only told me what I have now told you Elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation
b,my own strength and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming I am glad he dines here on Tuesday It will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance Yes very indifferent indeed said Elizabeth laughingly Oh Jane take care My dear Lizzy you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday and Mrs Bennet in the meanwhile
b,distress and diversion Mrs Bennet and Kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone Mr Collins began Believe me my dear Miss Elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mothers permission for this address You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
b,very essence of love Oh yes of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt Poor Jane I am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately It had better have happened to you Lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us Change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready
b,to Longbourn to see me and my family said Elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of itif indeed such a report is in existence If do you then pretend to be ignorant of it Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad I never heard that it was And can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer This is not to be borne
b,if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers Elizabeth made no answer She was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him He took the hint and soon began with This seems a very comfortable house Lady Catherine I believe did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first came to Hunsford I believe she didand I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object Mr Collins appears very
b,meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to Miss Bennet I beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so I took the liberty of coming to ask What do you mean Hill We have heard nothing from town Dear madam cried Mrs Hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from Mr Gardiner He has been here this half hour and master has had a letter Away ran the girls too eager to
b,down again wonder and bless herself Good gracious Lord bless me only think dear me Mr Darcy Who would have thought it And is it really true Oh my sweetest Lizzy how rich and how great you will be What pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have Janes is nothing to itnothing at all I am so pleasedso happy Such a charming man so handsome so tall Oh my dear Lizzy pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before I hope he will overlook it Dear dear Lizzy A house in town Everything that is charming Three
b,little recent piece of modesty The indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance When you told Mrs Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of
b,Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but I will not leave the country without confiding them and I trust you will not esteem them
b,you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible They were all astonished and Mr Bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said But is there not danger of Lady Catherines disapprobation here my good sir You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness My dear sir replied Mr Collins I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyships concurrence You can not be too
b,He has heartily forgiven me now Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr Bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin In anticipating the happiness of Bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house In the hall they parted Illustration Unable to utter a syllable Copyright 1894 by George Allen CHAPTER LIX Illustration My dear Lizzy where
b,from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds But I confess they would have no charms for me I should infinitely prefer a book But of this answer Lydia heard not a word She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to Mary at all In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how everybody went on but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme It should not be said that the Miss Bennets
b,hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr Bingley was incomprehensible She grew absolutely ashamed of herself Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd How despicably have I acted she cried I who have prided myself on my discernment I who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust How humiliating is this discovery Yet how just
b,breakfast the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr Wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over To Elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed I found said he as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr Darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might
b,almost promised to answer her letter The farewell between herself and Mr Wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must
b,every sister except Mary agreed to go with her and Mr Collins was to attend them at the request of Mr Bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither Mr Collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to Mr Bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at Hunsford Such doings discomposed Mr Bennet exceedingly In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as
b,I acted Regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but I wrote to Mr Wickham who left the place immediately and Mrs Younge was of course removed from her charge Mr Wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement His revenge would have been complete indeed This madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you
b,again very soon There was also a postscript to this effect I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence At present we have nothing to guide us Colonel Forster will I dare say do everything
b,a less interesting personage than to herself They had long wished to see him The whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love Of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough Elizabeth on her side had much to do She wanted
b,disappointed and angry with herself for being so Could I expect it to be otherwise said she Yet why did he come She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak She inquired after his sister but could do no more It is a long time Mr Bingley since you went away said Mrs Bennet He readily agreed to it I began to be afraid you would never come back again People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas but however I hope it is
b,dear Niece I have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you I must confess myself surprised by your application I did not expect it from you Dont think me angry however for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side If you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of
b,he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youMr Bingley and his sisters Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr Bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged There is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you Will you allow me or do I ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during
b,happiness of being his wife I advise you by all means to refuse him How can you talk so said Jane faintly smiling you must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation I could not hesitate I did not think you would and that being the case I can not consider your situation with much compassion But if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required A thousand things may arise in six months The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt It appeared to her merely
b,to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with Charlotte and the kind attention she had received must make her feel the obliged Mr Collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably We have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with Rosings the
b,friend Here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery And then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value She was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits
b,to Charlottes first sketch She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time and the plan became as perfect as plan could be The only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter The farewell between herself and Mr Wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more His present pursuit could not make him forget
b,and after a short pause added I think I have understood that Mr Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again I have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future He has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing If he means to be but little at Netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there
b,will consent to be of the party Indeed Eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them The wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual Elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as
b,I do not know Mrs Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton And so my dear sister I find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen Pemberley She replied in the affirmative I almost envy you the pleasure and yet I believe it would be too much for me or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle And you saw the old housekeeper I suppose Poor Reynolds she was always very fond of me But of course she did not mention my name to you Yes she did And what did
b,following note for Elizabeth NIND My dearest Lizzie I find myself very unwell this morning which I suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better They insist also on my seeing Mr Jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and a headache there is not much the matter with me Yours etc Well my dear said Mr Bennet when Elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a
b,well call it impertinence at once It was very little less The fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone I roused and interested you because I was so unlike them Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you ThereI
b,Even now I do not think that it would be impossible to find persons especially female persons not necessarily of noble birth as overbearing as selfcentred as neglectful of good manners as Lady Catherine A hundred years ago an earls daughter the Lady Powerful if not exactly Bountiful of an outoftheway country parish rich long out of marital authority and so forth had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now As for Mr Bennet Miss Austen and Mr Darcy and even Miss Elizabeth herself were I am inclined to think rather hard on him for the
b,explained what its effects on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed I knew said he that what I wrote must give you pain but it was necessary I hope you have destroyed the letter There was one part especially the opening of it which I should dread your having the power of reading again I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me The letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions
b,kindness of her aunt had reserved for them But Jane was to go home with her and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn before she told her sister of Mr Darcys proposals To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the
b,threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr Darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters matchwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligationwere proved beyond their greatest extent to be true He had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on
b,his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closets upstairs That is all very proper and civil I am sure said Mrs Bennet and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her Does she live near you sir The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park her Ladyships residence I think you said she was a widow sir
b,would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister As she pronounced these words Mr Darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued I have every reason in the world to think ill of you No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there You dare not you can not deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one
b,can you be so teasing I honour your circumspection A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight But if we do not venture somebody else will and after all Mrs Long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office I will take it on myself The girls stared at their father Mrs Bennet said only Nonsense nonsense What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he Do you consider
b,his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him He had never before supposed that could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through

b,something towards clearing him I can not believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced He has children of his own and may have more How could he spare half ten thousand pounds If we are ever able to learn what Wickhams debts have been said Elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what Mr Gardiner has done for them because Wickham has not sixpence of his own The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited Their taking her home and affording her their

b,fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should

b,in her brothers conversation with Miss Bennet Miss Bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr Darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page She could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on At length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said How pleasant it is to spend an evening

b,particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on Mrs Gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else Fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest
b,determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot Mr Denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend Mr Wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps This was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming His appearance was greatly in
b,whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time Mrs Bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months Of having another daughter married to Mr Collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her
b,with more distinction again became her favourites It may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey From Elizabeths thoughts it was never absent Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness They travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day It was a comfort to Elizabeth to
b,be surprised my dear Eliza Do you think it incredible that Mr Collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you But Elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness I see what you are feeling replied Charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as Mr Collins was wishing to marry you But when
b,had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr Darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr Wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed
b,think it is well expressed To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour As for their mother Mr Collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters Mr Collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness
b,greatgrandmother while on the other hand some I think unreasonably have found cynicism in touches of Miss Austens own such as her satire of Mrs Musgroves selfdeceiving regrets over her son But this word cynical is one of the most misused in the English language especially when by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense it is applied not to rough and snarling invective but to gentle and oblique satire If cynicism means the perception of the other side the sense of the accepted hells beneath the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed and that to seem
b,fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr Denny to whom Lydia eagerly applied and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here This part of his intelligence though unheard by Lydia was caught by Elizabeth and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickhams absence than if her first surmise
b,could not oppose such a wish and from this time Mr Bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them Mrs Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability
b,any of them There was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him And in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton He owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more

b,my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof It was unpardonable I can not think of it without abhorrence We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said Elizabeth The conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both I hope improved in civility I can not be so easily reconciled to myself The recollection of what I then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me Your
b,of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both I will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection He left Netherfield for London on the day following as you I am certain remember with the design of soon returning The part which I acted is now to be explained His sisters
b,now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink The wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this She was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what She became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it She wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least

b,her brother is the cause of it I need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable I can not but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago He knows of my being in town I am certain from something
b,by her sister Before any answer could arrive from Mr Collins or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that Charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over At such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think
b,allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it Elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house Mrs Gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible Her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for Mr Gardiner though seldom able to indulge
b,an angel I should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham What a good joke it will be I can hardly write for laughing Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him I will dance
b,at court very much and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to Mr Darcy about it if you had rather not Yours etc As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind Such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private
b,and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the diningparlour She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister Ah Jane I take your place now and you must go lower because I am a married woman It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first Her ease and good spirits increased She longed to see Mrs
b,say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true Much the same may be said of Kitty and Lydia but it is not every author even of genius who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages With Mary Miss Austen has taken rather less pains though she has been even more unkind to her not merely in the text but as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which Mr Austen Leigh has given us in dooming
b,and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley yet for Elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession Lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long that even Bingleys goodhumour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcys marriage but as she thought
b,wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind But perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her No said Colonel Fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy Are you indeed And pray what sort of a guardian do you make Does your charge give you much trouble Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has
b,compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible Mr Bennets expectations were fully answered His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure By teatime however the dose had been enough and Mr Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him Illustration
b,answer them all herself attention was necessarywhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections Mr Darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different When she
b,friends How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day Her aunt now called her to look at a picture She approached and saw the likeness of Mr Wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece Her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it The housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense He is now gone into the army she added but I am afraid
b,finewith less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of Rosings And of this place thought she I might have been mistress With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted Instead of viewing them as a stranger I might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt But no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them This was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret She longed
b,an attention as this Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival I am the less surprised at what has happened replied Sir William from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire About the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings Mr Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were
b,hold me I thank you for explaining it so fully My faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed But perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design These bitter accusations might have been suppressed had I with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything But disguise of every sort is
b,both with alternate smiles and tears When they were all in the drawingroom the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give The sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from Lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage Mrs Bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes
b,paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him He had never before supposed that could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands Lydias expenses had been very little within
b,do I hope you will think of us I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to Mr Darcy about it if you had rather not Yours etc As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind Such relief however as it was in her
b,complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene
b,and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little Whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and Elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of Mr Darcy approaching them and at no great distance The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met Elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them For a few
b,They gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House situated on the opposite side of the valley into which the road with some abruptness wound It was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned Elizabeth was delighted She had never
b,some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness Mr Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house The observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected He is perfectly wellbehaved polite and unassuming said her uncle There is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming I can now say
b,philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given Elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband She had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of
b,agreeable Heaven forbid That would be the greatest misfortune of all To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate Do not wish me such an evil When the dancing recommenced however and Darcy approached to claim her hand Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence Elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to
b,even horror oppressed her She wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming This must be false This can not be This must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again In this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she
b,the chief of this news had been given before in the course of Jane and Elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation When alone with Elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane said she I am sorry it went off But these things happen so often A young man such as you describe Mr Bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets
b,day I think everything has passed off uncommonly well I assure you The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw The venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases last week and even Mr Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least And my dear Jane I never saw you look in greater beauty Mrs Long said so too for I asked her whether
b,are He takes them now for people of fashion The introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions That he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with Mr Gardiner Elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph It was consoling that
b,life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter She is grown so brown and coarse Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again However little Mr Darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer For my own part she rejoined I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her Her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at
b,above all things keep Mr Bennet from fighting Tell him what a dreadful state I am inthat I am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at my heart that I can get no rest by night nor by day And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses Oh brother how kind you are I know you will contrive it
b,the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning I will only add God bless you FITZWILLIAM DARCY Illustration CHAPTER
b,a state of such insensibility I never can be thankful Mr Bennet for anything about the entail How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters I can not understand and all for the sake of Mr Collins too Why should he have it more than anybody else I leave it to yourself to determine said Mr Bennet Illustration CHAPTER XXIV Illustration Miss Bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter and concluded with her brothers
b,the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way The officer was the very Mr Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed All were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and Kitty and Lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement
c,how to speak good English now Im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears Im sure I shant be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk
c,one of its little eyes but it said nothing Perhaps it doesnt understand English thought Alice I daresay its a French mouse come over with William the Conqueror For with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened So she began again O est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her French lessonbook The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings I
c,with her friend When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said The executioners argument was
c,she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for I never was so small as this before never And I declare its too bad that it is As she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case I can
c,at the window and some of them hit her in the face Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out Youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I suppose So she swallowed
c,there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm A fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak voice Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time Take your choice The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back
c,way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake CHAPTER II The Pool of Tears Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much
c,my ears and whiskers how late its getting She was close behind it when she turned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again Suddenly she came upon a little threelegged
c,kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die The trial can not proceed said the King in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesall he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as he said so Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being
c,better ask her about it Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here And the executioner went off like an arrow The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the Duchess it had entirely disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtles Story You cant think how glad I am to see you again you dear old thing said the Duchess
c,teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles Then you keep moving round I suppose said Alice Exactly so said the Hatter as the things get used up But what happens when you come to the beginning again Alice ventured to ask Suppose we change the subject the March Hare interrupted yawning Im getting tired of this I vote the young lady tells us a story Im afraid I dont know one said Alice rather alarmed at the proposal Then the Dormouse shall they both cried Wake up Dormouse And they pinched it on both sides at

c,Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt again I dare say there may be one One indeed said the Dormouse indignantly However he consented to go on And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you know What did they draw said Alice quite forgetting her promise Treacle said the Dormouse without considering at all this time I want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter lets all move one place on He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare moved into the Dormouses place and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of
c,said Alice not that she wanted much to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything Why said the Dodo the best way to explain it is to do it And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it First it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there There
c,verdict the King said for about the twentieth time that day No no said the Queen Sentence firstverdict afterwards Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly The idea of having the sentence first Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple I wont said Alice Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice Nobody moved Who cares for you said Alice she had grown to her full size by this time Youre nothing but a pack of cards At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave
c,to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it Oh dear Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again Let me seehow is
c,been anxiously looking across the garden called out The Queen The Queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice looked round eager to see the Queen First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did After these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came

c,went down on one knee Im a poor man your Majesty he began Youre a very poor speaker said the King Here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court As that is rather a hard word I will just explain to you how it was done They had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it Im glad Ive seen that done thought Alice Ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of
c,difficult question However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand And now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to
c,away There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as Sure I dont like it yer honour at all at all Do as I tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass What a number of cucumberframes there must be thought Alice I wonder what theyll do next As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they could Im sure I dont want
c,I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob Ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them I havent the least idea what youre talking about said Alice Ive tried the roots of trees and Ive tried banks and Ive tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents Theres no pleasing them Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs
c,said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time Dont grunt said Alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it There could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all But perhaps
c,Knave Turn them over The Knave did so very carefully with one foot Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the King the Queen the royal children and everybody else Leave off that screamed the Queen You make me giddy And then turning to the rosetree she went on What have you been doing here May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying I see said the Queen who had meanwhile
c,dance to watch said Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and I do so like that curious song about the whiting Oh as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle theyyouve seen them of course Yes said Alice Ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily I dont know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs Youre wrong about the crumbs said
c,with them the Mock Turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise Wouldnt it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not said the Mock Turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey I should say With what porpoise Dont you mean purpose said Alice I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And the Gryphon added Come lets hear some of your adventures I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said Alice a little timidly but its
c,for you now dears Im sure I shant be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the way I want to go Let me see Ill give them a new pair of boots every Christmas And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet And how odd the directions
c,for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding Youre looking for eggs I know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent It matters a good deal to me said Alice hastily but Im not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnt want yours I dont like them raw Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for
c,Dormouse again so she began very cautiously But I dont understand Where did they draw the treacle from You can draw water out of a waterwell said the Hatter so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupid But they were in the well Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark Of course they were said the Dormouse well in This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbing
c,Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked goodnatured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider Come its pleased so far thought Alice and she went on Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here That depends a

c,of him while the rest waited in silence At last the Dodo said Everybody has won and all must have prizes But who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked Why she of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way Prizes Prizes Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them
c,on found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown Williams conduct at first was moderate But the insolence of his Normans How are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to Alice as it spoke As wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry me at all In that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet I move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies Speak English said the Eaglet I dont know the meaning of half

c,on But why did they live at the bottom of a well Take some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly Ive had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so I cant take more You mean you cant take less said the Hatter its very easy to take more than nothing Nobody asked your opinion said Alice Whos making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question
c,a little From the Queen An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the FishFootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked Theres no sort of use in knocking said the Footman and that for two reasons First because Im on
c,happens and if I was I shouldnt want yours I dont like them raw Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes

c,altogether That was a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for I never was so small as this before never And I declare its too bad that it is As she said these words her foot slipped and
c,as well as she could remember them all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures
c,any rate he might answer questionsHow am I to get in she repeated aloud I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the Footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened How am I to get in asked Alice again in a louder tone Are you to get in at all said the Footman

c,to yesterday because I was a different person then Explain all that said the Mock Turtle No no The adventures first said the Gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the
c,she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out
c,of you to sit down without being invited said the March Hare I didnt know it was your table said Alice its laid for a great many more than three Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said with some severity its very rude The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was Why is a raven like a writingdesk Come we shall have some fun now
c,I must be shutting up like a telescope And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder what I should be like then And she tried to
c,see that the mouse doesnt get out Only I dont think Alice went on that theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass
c,book written about me that there ought And when I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here But then thought Alice shall I never get any older than I am now Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldnt like that Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself How can you learn lessons in here Why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooks
c,of Rome and Romeno thats all wrong Im certain I must have been changed for Mabel Ill try and say How doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale How cheerfully he seems to grin How neatly spread his claws And welcome little fishes in With
c,now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life I do wonder what can have happened to me When I used to read fairytales I fancied

c,half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself Thats quite enoughI hope I shant grow any moreAs it is I cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so much Alas it was too late to wish that She went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with
c,screamed the Gryphon Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle capering wildly about Change lobsters again yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice Back to land again and thats all the first figure said the Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice It must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly Would you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle Very much indeed said Alice
c,Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please sir The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear dear How queer

c,Gryphon she wants for to know your history she do Ill tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till Ive finished So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes Alice thought to herself I dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin But she waited patiently Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was a real Turtle These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from
c,Alice in a piteous tone And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself Then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and
c,uncommon nonsense Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle She cant explain it said the Gryphon hastily Go on with the next verse But about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted How could he turn them out with his nose you know Its the first position in dancing Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject Go on with the next verse the Gryphon

c,narrow to be sure but I think I can kick a little She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of

c,was said and went by without noticing her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it So she stood
c,now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual Come theres

c,How should I know said Alice surprised at her own courage Its no business of mine The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head Off Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the Queen was silent The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said Consider my dear she is only a child The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave Turn them over The Knave did so very carefully with one foot Get up said the Queen
c,and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak Pray how did you manage to do it In my youth said his father I took to the law And argued each case with my wife And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw Has lasted the rest of my life You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose What made you so awfully clever
c,answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M Why with an M said Alice Why not said the March Hare Alice was silent The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that
c,verdict the King said to the jury Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted Theres a great deal to come before that Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First witness The first witness was the Hatter He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other I beg pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in but I hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for You ought to have finished said the King When
c,at this she was getting so used to queer things happening While she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again Bythebye what became of the baby said the Cat Id nearly forgotten to ask It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March

c,Alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know I dont believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding Youre looking for eggs I know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent It matters a good deal to me
c,struck her foot She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she
c,to said the King going up to Alice and looking at the Cats head with great curiosity Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice allow me to introduce it I dont like the look of it at all said the King however it may kiss my hand if it likes Id rather not the Cat remarked Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look at me like that He got behind Alice as he spoke A cat may look at a king said Alice Ive read that in some book but I dont remember where Well it
c,wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing Perhaps it doesnt understand English thought Alice I daresay its a French mouse come over with William the Conqueror For with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened So she began again O est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her French lessonbook The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals
c,The Antipathies I think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know Please Maam is this New Zealand or Australia and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling through the air Do you think you could manage it And what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking No itll never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere Down down down There was
c,tree in the wood continued the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky Ugh Serpent But Im not a serpent I tell you said Alice Im aIm a Well What are you said the Pigeon I can see youre trying to invent something IIm a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
c,thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to this mouse Everything is so outoftheway down here that I should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying So she began O Mouse do you know the way out of this pool I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse Alice thought this must be
c,labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave theyll all think me at home Why I wouldnt say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely true Down down down Would the fall never come to an end
c,and the Queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin
c,Then it ought to be Number One said Alice The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up Whats in it said the Queen I havent opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody It must have been that said the King unless it was written to nobody which
c,him or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened How am I to get in asked Alice again in a louder tone Are you to get in at all said the Footman Thats the first question you know It was no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so Its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue Its enough to drive one crazy The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations I shall sit here he said
c,head she said without even looking round Ill fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and he hurried off Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the Queens voice in the distance screaming with passion She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not So she went in search
c,saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I didnt know that cats could grin They all can said the Duchess and most of em do I dont know of any that do Alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation You dont know much said the Duchess and thats a fact Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well
c,your pocket he went on turning to Alice Only a thimble said Alice sadly Hand it over here said the Dodo Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could The
c,think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming How do you like the Queen said the
c,quite pleased to have got into a conversation You dont know much said the Duchess and thats a fact Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation While she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes The Duchess took no notice of them even when
c,been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were still running on the song Id have said to the porpoise Keep back please we dont want you with us They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise Wouldnt it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not said the Mock Turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey I should say With what porpoise Dont you mean purpose said Alice I mean what I say the
c,Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea But the snail replied Too far too far and gave a look askance Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not could not join the dance What matters it how far we go his scaly friend
c,to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles heavy sobs Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she
c,did thatIt was Bill I fancyWhos to go down the chimneyNay I shant You do itThat I wont thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to go down the chimney Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he said Alice to herself Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but I think I can kick a little She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal

c,as well the Hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It was the best butter you know Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity What a funny watch she remarked It tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is Why should it muttered the Hatter Does your watch tell you
c,hand if it likes Id rather not the Cat remarked Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look at me like that He got behind Alice as he spoke A cat may look at a king said Alice Ive read that in some book but I dont remember where Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and he called the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear I wish you would have this cat removed The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small Off with his head she said
c,clock in a twinkling Halfpast one time for dinner I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a whisper That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it you know Not at first perhaps said the Hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked Is that the way you manage Alice asked The Hatter shook his head mournfully Not I he replied We quarrelled last Marchjust before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare it was at
c,undertone importantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying which word sounded best Some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook cackled out Silence and read out from his book Rule Fortytwo All persons more than a mile high to leave the court Everybody looked at Alice Im not a mile high said Alice You are said the King
c,was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it So she stood still where she was and waited When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only
c,its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground Alice
c,dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said Alice Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess I make you a present of everything Ive said as yet A cheap sort of present thought Alice Im glad they dont give birthday presents like that But she did not venture to say it out loud Thinking again the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to fly
c,house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles It was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads She felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out
c,to a mouse That he met in the house Let us both go to law I will prosecute youCome Ill take no denial We must have a trial For really this morning Ive nothing to do Said the mouse to the cur Such a trial dear sir With no jury or judge would be wasting our breath Ill be judge Ill be jury Said cunning old Fury Ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely What are you thinking of I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly
c,your flamingo Shall I try the experiment He might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried Very true said the Duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite And the moral of that isBirds of a feather flock together Only mustard isnt a bird Alice remarked Right as usual said the Duchess what a clear way you have of putting things Its a mineral I think said Alice Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near here And the moral of
c,and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale How cheerfully he seems to grin How neatly spread his claws And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on I must be Mabel after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to
c,remark with variations I shall sit here he said on and off for days and days But what am I to do said Alice Anything you like said the Footman and began whistling Oh theres no use in talking to him said Alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and went in The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which
c,the air This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass What a number of cucumberframes there must be thought Alice I wonder what theyll do next As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they could Im sure I dont want to stay in here any longer She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words Wheres the other ladderWhy I hadnt to bring but one Bills got
c,had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise I think I should understand that better Alice said very politely if I had it written down but I cant quite follow it as you say it Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess replied in a pleased tone Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said Alice Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess I make you a present of everything Ive said as yet A cheap sort of present thought Alice Im glad they dont give birthday presents
c,shoes on and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one of the officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door Call the next witness said the King The next witness was the Duchesss cook She carried the pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once Give your evidence said the King Shant said the cook The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in
c,said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden I think that will be the best plan It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry An enormous puppy was looking
c,Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared I dont think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have croqueted the
c,large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why Pig She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again I didnt know that Cheshire
c,fairytales I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me that there ought And when I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here But then thought Alice shall I never get any older than I am now Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldnt like that Oh you foolish Alice
c,be It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned
c,that the Queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game The Queen smiled and passed on Who are you talking to said the King going up to Alice and looking at the Cats head with great curiosity Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice allow me to introduce it I dont like the look of it at all said the King however it may kiss my hand if it likes Id rather not the Cat remarked Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look
c,she heard her voice close to her ear Youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk I cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but I shall remember it in a bit Perhaps it hasnt one Alice ventured to remark Tut tut child said the Duchess Everythings got a moral if only you can find it And she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side as she spoke Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the Duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly
c,and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its
c,cook had disappeared Never mind said the King with an air of great relief Call the next witness And he added in an undertone to the Queen Really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness It quite makes my forehead ache Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name Alice CHAPTER XII Alices Evidence
c,like the largest telescope that ever was Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears Im sure I shant be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the way I want to go Let me see
c,she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor Alice it would be of very
c,three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did After these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts Next came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her Then
c,wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself Then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter One side of
c,Mock Turtle She cant explain it said the Gryphon hastily Go on with the next verse But about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted How could he turn them out with his nose you know Its the first position in dancing Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject Go on with the next verse the Gryphon repeated impatiently it begins I passed by his garden Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice I passed by
c,So you did old fellow said the others We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and Alice called out as loud as she could If you do Ill set Dinah at you There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I wonder what they will do next If they had any sense theyd take the roof off After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with A barrowful of what thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for
c,and dont speak a word till Ive finished So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes Alice thought to herself I dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin But she waited patiently Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was a real Turtle These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle Alice was very nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your interesting story but she
c,Alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus Yes please do but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker What a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the Lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter Ah my dear Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper Hold your tongue Ma said the young Crab a little snappishly Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster I wish I had our Dinah here I
c,closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her What can all that green stuff be
c,all dry he is gay as a lark And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark But when the tide rises and sharks are around His voice has a timid and tremulous sound Thats different from what I used to say when I was a child said the Gryphon Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle
c,always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life I do wonder what can have happened to me When I used to read fairytales I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me that there ought And when I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room
c,turned pale and fidgeted Give your evidence said the King and dont be nervous or Ill have you executed on the spot This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would
c,half no time Take your choice The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
c,to the Gryphon They cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on
c,much what would happen next Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face Very said Alice wheres the Duchess Hush Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered Shes under sentence of execution What for said Alice Did you say What a pity the Rabbit asked No I didnt said Alice I dont think its at all
c,ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed The players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head about once in a minute Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she
c,and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought
c,at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming How do you like the Queen said the Cat in a low voice Not at all said Alice shes so extremely Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that
c,this size why I should frighten them out of their wits So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high CHAPTER VI Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at
c,and a fan Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran How surprised hell be when he finds out who I am But Id better take him his fan and glovesthat is if I can find them As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it
c,a railway station However she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high I wish I hadnt cried so much said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out I shall be punished for it now I suppose by being drowned in my own tears That will be a queer thing to be sure However everything is queer today Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at
c,Alice and she went on Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the Cat I dont much care where said Alice Then it doesnt matter which way you go said the Cat so long as I get somewhere Alice added as an explanation Oh youre sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk long enough Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question What sort of people live about here In that direction
c,just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether That was a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for I never was so small as this before never And I declare its too bad that it is As she
c,Queen was silent The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said Consider my dear she is only a child The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave Turn them over The Knave did so very carefully with one foot Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the King the Queen the royal children and everybody else Leave off that screamed the Queen You make me giddy And then turning to the rosetree she went on What have you been
c,the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head about once in a minute Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me Theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive She was looking about for
c,may be said the Mock Turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs Youre wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea But they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyesTell her about the reason and all that he said to the Gryphon The reason is said the Gryphon that they would go with the lobsters
c,wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please sir The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear dear How queer everything is today And yesterday things
c,and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings Serpent screamed the Pigeon Im not a serpent said Alice indignantly Let me alone Serpent I
c,believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a
c,a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground So she
c,good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why Pig She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I didnt know that cats could grin They all can said the Duchess and most of em do I dont know of any that do Alice said very
c,punished for it now I suppose by being drowned in my own tears That will be a queer thing to be sure However everything is queer today Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to
c,as she could If you do Ill set Dinah at you There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I wonder what they will do next If they had any sense theyd take the roof off After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with A barrowful of what thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face Ill
c,as well say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see You might just as well say added the March Hare that I like what I get is the same thing as I get what I like You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing as I sleep when I breathe It is the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a
c,they lessen from day to day This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday Of course it was said the Mock Turtle And how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly Thats enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now CHAPTER X The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes He looked at Alice and
c,passionate voice Would you like cats if you were me Well perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her She is such a dear quiet thing Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one
c,feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door Poor Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way Stop this moment I tell you But she went on all the same shedding
c,caused a remarkable sensation among the party Some of the birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking I really must be getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children Come away my dears Its high time you were all in bed On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone Nobody seems to like her down here and Im sure shes the
c,the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly Ive had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so I cant take more You mean you cant take less said the Hatter its very easy to take more than nothing Nobody asked your opinion said Alice Whos making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question Why did they live at the bottom of a well The Dormouse again took a minute
c,Hearts he stole those tarts And took them quite away Consider your verdict the King said to the jury Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted Theres a great deal to come before that Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First witness The first witness was the Hatter He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other I beg pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in but I hadnt quite finished my tea when I
c,she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it
c,of the court and I never understood what it meant till now If thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the King I cant go no lower said the Hatter Im on the floor as it is Then you may sit down the King replied Here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed Come that finished the guineapigs thought Alice Now we shall get on better Id rather finish my tea said the Hatter with an anxious look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers You may go said the King and the
c,verses to himself We know it to be true thats the jury of courseI gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know But it goes on they all returned from him to you said Alice Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table Nothing can be clearer than that Then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear I think he said to the Queen Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke
c,waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesHold up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it old fellow What happened to you Tell us all about it Last came a little feeble
c,obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise Wouldnt it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not said the Mock Turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey I should say With what porpoise Dont you mean purpose said Alice I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And the Gryphon added Come lets hear some of your adventures I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said Alice a
c,children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts Next came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie
c,drinking They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a minute or two They couldnt have done that you know Alice gently remarked theyd have been ill So they were said the Dormouse very ill Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on But why did they live at the bottom of a well Take some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly Ive had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so I cant take more
c,isnt a letter after all its a set of verses Are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen No theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it The jury all looked puzzled He must have imitated somebody elses hand said the King The jury all brightened up again Please your Majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and they cant prove I did theres no name signed at the end If you didnt sign it said the King that only makes the matter worse You must have meant some mischief or
c,Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted Give your evidence said the King and dont be nervous or Ill have you executed on the spot This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was
