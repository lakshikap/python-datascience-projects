# Python Datascience Projects  
1. This repository contains all the practice sessions and the data science projects carried out in python in the Code Basics online certification course.  
2. **Basic coding folder** - I start with simple basic codes like variables, strings, lists, if-else, loops etc to complex coding exercises involving these basic codes. Here, you will see lesson files and exercises, the latter being coding tests which I have completed on my own after some guided tutorials.  
3. **Pandas folder** - I move onto learn Pandas and complex projects using its features.  
4. I use **Jupyter Notebook** and **PyCharm** as IDEs in these exercises.
