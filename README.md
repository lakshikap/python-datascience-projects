# python-datascience-projects  
1. This repository contains all the practice sessions and the data science projects carried out in python in the Code Basics online certification course.  
2. I start with simple basic codes like variables, strings, lists, if-else, loops etc to complex coding exercises involving these basic codes.  
3. Then I move onto Pandas and complex projects using their features.
