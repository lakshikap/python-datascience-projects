# Python Data Science Projects
1. This repository contains several uOttawa course based projects and personal projects.
2. Course based projects are from DTI5125 Data Science Applications.
3. Personal Projects are from several online certification courses for which the certificates are displayed on LinkedIn.
4. I use **Jupyter Notebook,** **PyCharm,** **Google Collab** and **VSCode** as IDEs in these projects.
5. All projects have a readme file which guides you except for the basic and advanced coding folders as they are beginners codes.

# In the journey to enhance programming skills
I have more projects in the pipeline, and I look forward to publishing them!
