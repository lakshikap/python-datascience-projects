clinical depression,Although anxiety and depression have been considered as two distinct entities according to the diagnostic criteria anxious depression comorbid anxiety and depression is relatively a common syndrome According to the DSM criteria it uses with anxious distress specifier to define anxious depression in its MDD section Anxious depression is known to have different neurobiological profiles compared to nonanxious depression Several studies have revealed significant differences between anxious depression and nonanxious depression regarding the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal HPA axis function structural and functional brain imaging findings inflammation markers etc Patients with anxious depression were significantly more likely to be found in primary care
clinical depression,Major depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating personal and public health conditions worldwide Less appreciated is that depressions tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives whereas half or more will never have a recurrence Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depressions first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory The lack of recognition of this
clinical depression,ObjectiveAdolescence is a formative and turbulent phase where physiological psychosocial and cognitive changes leave adolescents vulnerable to psychological disorders Given the lack of reviews that consolidate and compare worldwide prevalence of depression among adolescents this review aims to examine the global prevalence of major depressive disorders dysthymia and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescentsMethodsA systematic review and metaanalysis was conducted Six databases were searched for studies published from 2001 to December 2020 Seventytwo studies were included Subgroup analysis were performed for year of publication geographical region gender and assessment tools usedResultsThe global point prevalence rate of elevated selfreported depressive symptoms from
clinical depression,2001 to 2020 was CI Point prevalence for major depressive disorder MDD and dysthymia was CI and CI respectively The pooled oneyear prevalence and lifetime prevalence for MDD were CI and CI Point prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents increased from CI between 2001 and 2010 to CI between 2011 and 2020 The Middle East Africa and Asia have the highest prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and female adolescents were reported to have a higher prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms than male adolescentsConclusionBesides targeting those with existing clinical depression research and policies should also focus on educational and supportive
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD
clinical depression,Purpose of reviewWe give an overview of recent developments on psychological treatments of depression in primary careRecent findingsIn recent years it has become clear that psychotherapies can effectively be delivered through ehealth applications Furthermore several studies in low and middle income countries have shown that lay health counselors can effectively deliver psychological therapies Behavioral activation a relatively simple form of therapy has been found to be as effective as cognitive behavior therapy Treatment of subthreshold depression has been found to not only reduce depressive symptoms but also prevent the onset of major depression In addition therapies are effective in older
clinical depression,BackgroundBurnout and clinical depression have been variably viewed as synonymous or as distinctly differing entities but with few distinguishing features provided Failure to differentiate the two conditions can lead to compromised clinical management We sought to enhance the differentiation of burnout and clinical depression by assembling a list of candidate differentiating featuresMethodsIn assembling a set of distinguishing clinical features we compared burnout states against the two principal depressive subtypes ie melancholic and nonmelancholic depression rather than against major depression per se Our candidate features were assembled from a review of salient literature our clinical observations and from a subsample of
clinical depression,The interaction of physical and mental vulnerability and environmental constraints is thought to foster the development of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD A central factor in the development of psychopathology is mental stress Despite some evidence for parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity in MDD the psychophysiological response to stress in depression is not clearcut Given the growing interest in heart rate and heart rate variability as indicators for remote monitoring of patients it is important to understand how patients with MDD react to stress in a laboratorycontrolled environment We conducted a systematic review of studies using electrocardiography
clinical depression,to derive heart rate and heart rate variability during stress in patients with clinical depression We focused on wellvalidated stress tasks the mental arithmetic stress task the Trier social stress task and public speaking task to minimize confounding effects due to the nature of the stressor The majority of studies found hyporeactivity during stress as a hallmark of depression as evidenced by lower fluctuation in heart rate and heart rate variability in the highfrequency band We address the potential underlying biological mechanisms the influence of covariates on these measures and briefly discuss the specificity and potential for remote monitoring by
clinical depression,It has been years since repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC was approved by the FDA for clinical depression treatment Yet the underlying mechanisms for rTMSinduced depression relief are not fully elucidated This study analyzes TMSelectroencephalogram EEG data from healthy control HC subjects and patients with major depressive disorder MDD before and after rTMS treatment Prior to treatment patients with MDD have lower activity in the DLPFC the hippocampus HPC the orbitofrontal cortex OFC and DLPFCOFC connectivity compared with HCs Following active rTMS treatment patients with MDD show a significant increase in the DLPFC HPC
clinical depression,ObjectiveTo consider how a mental health professional might respond to a newly diagnosed depressed patient who inquires into its potential genetic origins and whether they might pass depression on to their childrenMethodsData are provided on risk and pursuit of genetic pathwaysResultsAs most studies have focussed on DSMdefined major depression and which is not an entity no definitive data are available while there are some few studies indicating a greater genetic risk in those with melancholic than those with nonmelancholic depressionConclusionWe will not know the genetic contribution to clinical depression unless its key subtypes are evaluated as separate conditions Findings may
clinical depression,In this Seminar we discuss developments from the past years in the diagnosis neurobiology and treatment of major depressive disorder For diagnosis psychiatric and medical comorbidity have been emphasised as important factors in improving the appropriate assessment and management of depression Advances in neurobiology have also increased and we aim to indicate genetic molecular and neuroimaging studies that are relevant for assessment and treatment selection of this disorder Further studies of depressionspecific psychotherapies the continued application of antidepressants the development of new treatment compounds and the status of new somatic treatments are also discussed We address two treatmentrelated issues suicide
clinical depression,Treatmentresistant depression TRD typically refers to inadequate response to at least one antidepressant trial of adequate doses and duration TRD is a relatively common occurrence in clinical practice with up to to of the patients not achieving adequate response following antidepressant treatment A diagnostic reevaluation is essential to the proper management of these patients In particular the potential role of several contributing factors such as medical and psychiatric comorbidity needs to be taken into account An accurate and systematic assessment of TRD is a challenge to both clinicians and researchers with the use of clinicianrated or selfrated instruments being perhaps
clinical depression,Major Depressive Disorder MDD is common among cancer patients with prevalence rates up to fourtimes higher than the general population Depression confers worse outcomes including nonadherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression Moreover psychosocial stressors in cancer promote inflammation and oxidativenitrosative stress a decreased immunosurveillance and a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous system and of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis Consequently the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms
clinical depression,Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder MDD with deficits observed across several domains eg executive function memory attention While depression alone is disabling patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments poorer clinical recovery and reduced quality of life Consequently it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD Areas covered This review spans psychological physical and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression Where possible the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains eg attention and highlight the differential
clinical depression,Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression but despite advances in pharmacological therapies many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response even after treatments with several medications As such there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient Areas covered This review examines the recent findings coming from different omic sciences in human bloodbased biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on geneticepigenetic and biochemical biomarkers Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity
clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing
clinical depression,normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad other specified bipolar and related disorders New specifiers of MDD with anxious distress and with mixed features allow
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly
clinical depression,Pleasure and motivation are important factors for goaldirected behavior and wellbeing in both animals and humans Intact hedonic capacity requires an undisturbed interplay between a number of different brain regions and transmitter systems Concordantly dysfunction of networks encoding for reward have been shown in depression and other psychiatric disorders The development of technological possibilities to investigate connectivity on a functional level in humans and to directly influence networks in animals using optogenetics among other techniques has provided new important insights in this field of researchIn this review we aim to provide an overview on the neurobiological substrates of anhedonia on
clinical depression,a network level For this purpose definition of anhedonia and the involved reward components are described first then current data on reward networks in healthy individuals and in depressed patients are summarized and the roles of different neurotransmitter systems involved in reward processing are specified Based on this information the impact of different therapeutic approaches on reward processing is described with a particular focus on deep brain stimulation DBS as a possibility for a direct modulation of human brain structures in vivoOverall results of current studies emphasize the importance of anhedonia in psychiatric disorders and the relevance of targeting this
clinical depression,Depression clinical interview corpora are essential for advancing automated depression diagnosis While previous studies have used written speech material in controlled settings these materials do not accurately represent spontaneous conversational speech Additionally selfreported measures of depression are subject to bias making the data unreliable for training models for realworld scenarios This study introduces a new corpus of depression clinical interviews collected directly from a psychiatric hospital containing recordings with healthy and depressive patients The subjects were examined using the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS in Chinese Their final diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by
clinical depression,Although there is some debate about the relative prevalence rates of depression in African Americans compared to Whites there is little debate among investigators that there is a shortage of research data on depression in African Americans generally and more specifically on African American women Lack of adequate and sufficient research on African Americans contributes to the problems of misdiagnoses underdiagnoses and undertreatment of depression in African Americans generally and more specifically African American women the focus of this special section African American women are understudied underserved and misdiagnosed as a group A paucity of studies on depression in African

clinical depression,The past decade has witnessed a resurgence of interest in behavioral interventions for depression This contemporary work is grounded in the work of Lewinsohn and colleagues which laid a foundation for future clinical practice and science This review thus summarizes the origins of a behavioral model of depression and the behavioral activation BA approach to the treatment and prevention of depression We highlight the formative initial work by Lewinsohn and colleagues the evolution of this work and related contemporary research initiatives such as that led by Jacobson and colleagues We examine the diverse ways in which BA has been investigated
clinical depression,BackgroundSymptom severity as a moderator of treatment response has been the subject of debate over the past years Each of the meta and megaanalyses examining the treatment significance of depression severity used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD wholly or in part to define severity though the cutoff used to define severe depression varied There is limited empirical research establishing cutoff scores for bands of severity on the HAMD The goal of the study is to empirically establish cutoff scores on the HAMD in their allocation of patients to severity groupsMethodsSix hundred twentyseven outpatients with current major depressive disorder were
clinical depression,evaluated with a semistructured diagnostic interview Scores on the item HAMD were derived from ratings according to the conversion method described by Endicott et al 1981 The patients were also rated on the Clinical Global Index of Severity CGI Receiver operating curves were computed to identify the cutoff that optimally discriminated between patients with mild vs moderate and moderate vs severe depressionResultsHAMD scores were significantly lower in patients with mild depression than patients with moderate depression and patients with moderate depression scored significantly lower than patients with severe depression The cutoff score on the HAMD that maximized the sum of
clinical depression,sensitivity and specificity was for the comparison of mild vs moderate depression and for the comparison of moderate vs severe depressionLimitationsThe present study was conducted in a single outpatient practice in which the majority of patients were white female and had health insurance Although the study was limited to a single site a strength of the recruitment procedure was that the sample was not selected for participation in a treatment study and exclusion and inclusion criteria did not reduce the representativeness of the patient groups The analyses were based on HAMD scores extracted from ratings on the SADS However we

clinical depression,Sleep disturbances are almost always present in patients with depression Though sleep disturbances generally abate with the resolution of depression some patients continue to report poor sleep Since a number of studies have demonstrated that insomnia increases the risk of newonset depression and recurrence of depression optimal management of insomnia associated with depression becomes an important clinical goal Antidepressant agents have variable effects on sleep and in fact some antidepressants seem to worsen sleep in patients with depression This article reviews various treatment options in the management of patients presenting with insomnia and depression including single agents combination strategies and
clinical depression,BackgroundThe DSM concept of major depression has accrued increased status but demonstrated limited utility since inceptionMethodAn historical overview of models of depression and the initially perceived advantages presented by the concept of major depression are presented before detailing its limitations in applicationResultsChallenges to the utility of major depression are provided by examining its conceptual model its validity its utility and the limited information generated in aetiological and treatment efficacy studiesConclusionIt is argued that the concept of major depression has led to sterility in depression research and clinical practice and that there is a need for a paradigm shift in modelling
clinical depression,Purpose of reviewScreening for clinical depression and bipolar disorder remains controversial Screening is usually based on finding discriminating symptoms but not all tools perform equally well Clinicians should be able to assess the clinical utility of screening tests as well as their accuracy and acceptabilityRecent findingsScreening for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ has been extensively examined Four main versions of scoring the PHQ exist The twoitem PHQ2 the nineitem PHQ9 the PHQ DSMIV algorithm and the twostep PHQ2 then PHQ9 Recent results suggest that the PHQ9 is more accurate than the PHQ2 and that the algorithm scoring method
clinical depression,is preferred to the linear cutoff score The twostep procedure has promise but it has not been adequately tested Two screening questions may be a useful compromise in medical settings as they take less than min but about a quarter of patients do not receive screening even when implemented systematically Alternative customized questionnaires have been developed in medical settings such as the Depression Screening in Parkinsons Disease DESPAR and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy NDDIE Screening for bipolar disorders is an even greater challenge than screening for unipolar depression Screening in primary care and the community has low positive

clinical depression,Purpose of reviewAs the monoamine hypothesis of depression fails to explain all aspects of major depression additional causes are being investigated Several observations suggest that inflammatory mechanisms pay a role in the cause of major depressive disorder MDD This article reviews their role in major depressionRecent findingsRecent studies support the concept that inflammatory mechanisms play a crucial role in the pathomechanisms of major depression Major depression shares similarities with sickness behavior a normal response to inflammatory cytokines Elevations in proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammationrelated proteins in major depression were found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid CSF as well as in
clinical depression,Symptoms of anxiety and depression often coexist and evidence suggests that this has a genetic basis among other possible causes However the current classification of comorbid generalised anxiety disorder GAD and depression anxious depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition DSM does not fully reflect the high prevalence of anxiety symptoms in people with depression and the International Classification of Diseases 10th and 11th revisions has tended to identify anxious depression with minor disorders seen in primary care As a result few dedicated therapeutic trials have been conducted in patients with anxious depression and specific

clinical depression,The chronic and recurrent nature of major depressive disorder is receiving increasing attention Approximately eight of ten people experiencing a major depressive episode will have at least one more episode during their lifetime ie recurrent major depressive disorder In the 1990s prolonged or lifelong pharmacotherapy emerged as the main therapeutic tool for preventing relapses of depression This therapeutic approach is based on the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs compared with placebo in decreasing relapse risk and on the improved tolerability profile of the newer antidepressants compared with their older counterparts However outcome after discontinuation of antidepressant therapy does not seem to
clinical depression,be affected by the duration of administration Loss of clinical effects despite adequate compliance has also emerged as a vexing clinical problem The use of intermittent pharmacotherapy with followup visits is an alternative therapeutic option This leaves patients with periods free of drugs and adverse effects and takes into account that a high proportion of patients would discontinue the antidepressant anyway However the problems of resistance that a drug treatment may be associated with a diminished chance of response in subsequent treatments in those patients whose symptoms successfully responded to it but who discontinued it and of discontinuation syndromes are
clinical depression,substantial disadvantages of this therapeutic approach In recent years several controlled trials have suggested that sequential use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute depressive episode and psychotherapy in its residual phase may improve longterm outcome Patients however need to be motivated for psychotherapy and skilled therapists have to be available Despite an impressive amount of research into the treatment of depression there is still a paucity of studies addressing the specific problems that prevention of recurrent depression entails It is important to discuss with the patient the various therapeutic options and to adapt strategies to the specific needs
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous disorder mostly diagnosed on the basis of symptomatic criteria alone It would be of great help when specific biomarkers for various subtypes and symptom clusters of depression become available to assist in diagnosis and subtyping of depression and to enable monitoring and prognosis of treatment response However currently known biomarkers do not reach sufficient sensitivity and specificity and often the relation to underlying pathophysiology is unclear In this review we evaluate various biomarker approaches in terms of scientific merit and clinical applicability Finally we discuss how combined biomarker approaches in both preclinical and clinical
clinical depression,PurposeTo examine the role of perceived risk and personal and clinical experience in medical students treatment seeking behavior for major depressionMethodIn 2003 a questionnaire was administered to firstyear and fourthyear medical students at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine to assess students perception of risk for major depression in the general population and personal and clinical experience with major depression Treatmentseeking behavior was examined using a hypothetical scenario Data analysis used analysis of variance and regression modelsResultsA total of firstyear and fourthyear students completed the questionnaire The majority overestimated the risk for major depression in the general population p although

clinical depression,It has been argued that clinical depression is accompanied by reductions in cortical excitability of the left prefrontal cortex PFC In support of this repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS which is a method of enhancing cortical excitability has shown antidepressant efficacy when applied over the left PFC although the overall therapeutic effects remain inconclusive The cerebral pathophysiology of depression is however not limited to dysfunctions in the PFC thus targeting alternative brain regions with rTMS may provide new therapeutic windows in the treatment of depression Evidence from electroencephalography and lesion studies suggests that not only is the left PFC involved
clinical depression,Major life events and chronic difficulties have been found to be associated with the onset of depression Little is known however about how exposure to such stressors is related to the clinical presentation of this disorder We addressed this issue by administering an interviewbased measure of life stress the Beck Depression Inventory and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale to adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder Participants who experienced a preonset severe life event exhibited greater overall levels of depression severity endorsed more cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression and functioned at lower levels than did their counterparts without preonset
clinical depression,Although the lifetime burden due to major depressive disorder is increasing we lack tools for selecting the most effective treatments for each patient Onethird to onehalf of patients with major depressive disorder do not respond to treatment and we lack strategies for selecting among available treatments or expediting access to new treatment options This critical review concentrates on functional neuroimaging as a modality of measurement for precision psychiatry We begin by summarizing the current landscape of how functional neuroimagingderived circuit predictors can forecast treatment outcomes in depression Then we outline the opportunities and challenges in integrating circuit predictors into clinical
clinical depression,ObjectivePast taxometric studies of depression have yielded equivocal results Diversity of sample type may provide one explanation for this The aim of the present study was to examine the latent structure of depression across clinical and community samples using exactly the same taxometric procedures involving exactly the same indicators of depressionMethodTwo taxometric procedures MAXEIG maximum eigenvalue and MAMBAC mean above minus mean below a cut were carried out on a clinical sample of outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders Simulated categorical and dimensional data sets as well as other consistency tests aided in the interpretation of the research data Results
clinical depression,Clinical depression and other psychological disorders have been associated with suicidal ideation attempts and deaths Because of the link between suicide and mental illness whenever discussion of assisted suicide arises the possibility that major depression is affecting the decision arises This article examines the literature on clinical depression as it relates to suicide assisted suicide and other decisions that will hasten death ie withholding and withdrawing treatment terminal sedation and voluntarily stopping eating and drinking Ethical and legal considerations when working with individuals who are considering taking an action that would hasten death are also briefly reviewed The article ends

clinical depression,Although anxiety and depression have been considered as two distinct entities according to the diagnostic criteria anxious depression comorbid anxiety and depression is relatively a common syndrome According to the DSM criteria it uses with anxious distress specifier to define anxious depression in its MDD section Anxious depression is known to have different neurobiological profiles compared to nonanxious depression Several studies have revealed significant differences between anxious depression and nonanxious depression regarding the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal HPA axis function structural and functional brain imaging findings inflammation markers etc Patients with anxious depression were significantly more likely to be found in primary care
clinical depression,Major depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating personal and public health conditions worldwide Less appreciated is that depressions tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives whereas half or more will never have a recurrence Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depressions first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory The lack of recognition of this
clinical depression,ObjectiveAdolescence is a formative and turbulent phase where physiological psychosocial and cognitive changes leave adolescents vulnerable to psychological disorders Given the lack of reviews that consolidate and compare worldwide prevalence of depression among adolescents this review aims to examine the global prevalence of major depressive disorders dysthymia and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescentsMethodsA systematic review and metaanalysis was conducted Six databases were searched for studies published from 2001 to December 2020 Seventytwo studies were included Subgroup analysis were performed for year of publication geographical region gender and assessment tools usedResultsThe global point prevalence rate of elevated selfreported depressive symptoms from
clinical depression,2001 to 2020 was CI Point prevalence for major depressive disorder MDD and dysthymia was CI and CI respectively The pooled oneyear prevalence and lifetime prevalence for MDD were CI and CI Point prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents increased from CI between 2001 and 2010 to CI between 2011 and 2020 The Middle East Africa and Asia have the highest prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and female adolescents were reported to have a higher prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms than male adolescentsConclusionBesides targeting those with existing clinical depression research and policies should also focus on educational and supportive
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD

clinical depression,BackgroundBurnout and clinical depression have been variably viewed as synonymous or as distinctly differing entities but with few distinguishing features provided Failure to differentiate the two conditions can lead to compromised clinical management We sought to enhance the differentiation of burnout and clinical depression by assembling a list of candidate differentiating featuresMethodsIn assembling a set of distinguishing clinical features we compared burnout states against the two principal depressive subtypes ie melancholic and nonmelancholic depression rather than against major depression per se Our candidate features were assembled from a review of salient literature our clinical observations and from a subsample of
clinical depression,The interaction of physical and mental vulnerability and environmental constraints is thought to foster the development of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD A central factor in the development of psychopathology is mental stress Despite some evidence for parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity in MDD the psychophysiological response to stress in depression is not clearcut Given the growing interest in heart rate and heart rate variability as indicators for remote monitoring of patients it is important to understand how patients with MDD react to stress in a laboratorycontrolled environment We conducted a systematic review of studies using electrocardiography
clinical depression,to derive heart rate and heart rate variability during stress in patients with clinical depression We focused on wellvalidated stress tasks the mental arithmetic stress task the Trier social stress task and public speaking task to minimize confounding effects due to the nature of the stressor The majority of studies found hyporeactivity during stress as a hallmark of depression as evidenced by lower fluctuation in heart rate and heart rate variability in the highfrequency band We address the potential underlying biological mechanisms the influence of covariates on these measures and briefly discuss the specificity and potential for remote monitoring by

clinical depression,Major Depressive Disorder MDD is common among cancer patients with prevalence rates up to fourtimes higher than the general population Depression confers worse outcomes including nonadherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression Moreover psychosocial stressors in cancer promote inflammation and oxidativenitrosative stress a decreased immunosurveillance and a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous system and of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis Consequently the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms
clinical depression,Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder MDD with deficits observed across several domains eg executive function memory attention While depression alone is disabling patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments poorer clinical recovery and reduced quality of life Consequently it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD Areas covered This review spans psychological physical and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression Where possible the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains eg attention and highlight the differential
clinical depression,Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression but despite advances in pharmacological therapies many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response even after treatments with several medications As such there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient Areas covered This review examines the recent findings coming from different omic sciences in human bloodbased biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on geneticepigenetic and biochemical biomarkers Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity
clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing
clinical depression,normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad other specified bipolar and related disorders New specifiers of MDD with anxious distress and with mixed features allow
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly
clinical depression,Pleasure and motivation are important factors for goaldirected behavior and wellbeing in both animals and humans Intact hedonic capacity requires an undisturbed interplay between a number of different brain regions and transmitter systems Concordantly dysfunction of networks encoding for reward have been shown in depression and other psychiatric disorders The development of technological possibilities to investigate connectivity on a functional level in humans and to directly influence networks in animals using optogenetics among other techniques has provided new important insights in this field of researchIn this review we aim to provide an overview on the neurobiological substrates of anhedonia on
clinical depression,a network level For this purpose definition of anhedonia and the involved reward components are described first then current data on reward networks in healthy individuals and in depressed patients are summarized and the roles of different neurotransmitter systems involved in reward processing are specified Based on this information the impact of different therapeutic approaches on reward processing is described with a particular focus on deep brain stimulation DBS as a possibility for a direct modulation of human brain structures in vivoOverall results of current studies emphasize the importance of anhedonia in psychiatric disorders and the relevance of targeting this
clinical depression,Depression clinical interview corpora are essential for advancing automated depression diagnosis While previous studies have used written speech material in controlled settings these materials do not accurately represent spontaneous conversational speech Additionally selfreported measures of depression are subject to bias making the data unreliable for training models for realworld scenarios This study introduces a new corpus of depression clinical interviews collected directly from a psychiatric hospital containing recordings with healthy and depressive patients The subjects were examined using the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS in Chinese Their final diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by

clinical depression,BackgroundSymptom severity as a moderator of treatment response has been the subject of debate over the past years Each of the meta and megaanalyses examining the treatment significance of depression severity used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD wholly or in part to define severity though the cutoff used to define severe depression varied There is limited empirical research establishing cutoff scores for bands of severity on the HAMD The goal of the study is to empirically establish cutoff scores on the HAMD in their allocation of patients to severity groupsMethodsSix hundred twentyseven outpatients with current major depressive disorder were
clinical depression,evaluated with a semistructured diagnostic interview Scores on the item HAMD were derived from ratings according to the conversion method described by Endicott et al 1981 The patients were also rated on the Clinical Global Index of Severity CGI Receiver operating curves were computed to identify the cutoff that optimally discriminated between patients with mild vs moderate and moderate vs severe depressionResultsHAMD scores were significantly lower in patients with mild depression than patients with moderate depression and patients with moderate depression scored significantly lower than patients with severe depression The cutoff score on the HAMD that maximized the sum of
clinical depression,sensitivity and specificity was for the comparison of mild vs moderate depression and for the comparison of moderate vs severe depressionLimitationsThe present study was conducted in a single outpatient practice in which the majority of patients were white female and had health insurance Although the study was limited to a single site a strength of the recruitment procedure was that the sample was not selected for participation in a treatment study and exclusion and inclusion criteria did not reduce the representativeness of the patient groups The analyses were based on HAMD scores extracted from ratings on the SADS However we

clinical depression,The clinical implications of thyroid hormones in depression have been studied extensively and still remains disputable Supplementation of thyroid hormones is considered to augment and accelerate antidepressant treatment Studies on the role of thyroid hormones in depression deliver contradictory results Here we assess theirs impact on depression severity and final clinical outcome in patients with major depression Thyrotropin free thyroxine FT4 and free triiodothyronine FT3 concentrations were measured with automated quantitative enzyme immunoassay Depression severity and final clinical outcome were rated with itemic Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression HDRS and Clinical Global Impression Scales for severity and for improvement CGIs
clinical depression,CGIi FT3 and FT4 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with clinical improvement evaluated with CGIi R P R P respectively There was a significant correlation between FT4 concentrations and depression severity assessed in HDRS R P Male patients presented significantly higher FT3 serum levels Z P and significantly greater clinical improvement Z P when compared to female patients We conclude that free thyroid hormones concentrations are associated with depression severity and have an impact on final clinical outcome It can be more efficient to augment and accelerate the treatment of major depressive disorder with triiodothyronine instead of levothyroxine because of
clinical depression,Residual symptoms of variable intensity often persist following pharmacoor psychotherapeutic interventions for treatment of major depression MD In several studies such persistent symptoms have been clearly shown to be associated with a higher risk of relapse chronicity and functional impairment but their true nature is still controversial Several authors consider that these symptoms belong to the range of depression proper and thus indicate that the current episode has been inadequately treated a hypothesis reinforced by their frequent similarity with the symptoms preceding the fullblown picture of MD However in the current state of research their connection with certain personality traits

clinical depression,The 2009 Institute of Medicine report on prevention of mental emotional and behavioral disorders National Research Council Institute of Medicine 2009b presented evidence that major depression can be prevented In this article we highlight the implications of the report for public policy and research Randomized controlled trials have shown that the incidence of major depressive episodes can be significantly reduced Metaanalyses suggest that to of major depressive episodes could be prevented with currently available methods We argue that if major depressive episodes can be prevented the health care system should provide routine access to evidencebased depression prevention interventions just as
clinical depression,it provides inoculations for other common and debilitating health problems At the same time researchers should pursue the major directions advocated by the Institute of Medicine report to increase the enduring effectiveness of future prevention interventions These directions include taking a developmental perspective learning to identify groups at high risk and testing evidencebased interventions that are likely to have the widest reach Scientific evidence has shown that clinical depression can be averted Our societies must take action to reduce clinical depression to the lowest possible level This article is one of three in a special section see also Biglan Flay
clinical depression,IntroductionThis article will demonstrate that the most widely used versions of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression HAMD used in randomized clinical trials the Guy 1976 HAMD1and the SIGHD2have response options that deviate sharply from Max Hamiltons 19603and 19674guidelines For example difficulty in concentration one of the diagnostic criteria for a Major Depressive Episode according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM since 1980 in editions III IV IVTR and 5is something that Hamilton wrote should be measured in his scale yet it is not measured in either of the presently used HAMDsMethodA review was conducted of

clinical depression,ObjectiveThis study examined whether clinical depression is associated with a differential inflammatory response to an acute bout of psychological stressMethodsA total of women participated in the study half met diagnostic criteria for clinical depression the others had no history of psychiatric illness The groups were matched with respect to age and ethnicity All subjects were exposed to a minute mockjob interview blood was drawn to assess secretion and regulation of inflammatory moleculesResultsThe stressor was associated with feelings of shame and anxiety a mobilization of monocytes neutrophils and Creactive protein into the circulation and greater endotoxinstimulated production of interleukin and tumor
clinical depression,necrosis factoralpha by white blood cells in vitro Depressed subjects began the session with greater sensitivity to the antiinflammatory properties of glucocorticoids than control subjects Following exposure to the stressor protocol however sensitivity decreased among depressed subjects and increased among controls This was manifest by disparities in interleukin and tumor necrosis factoralpha production in the presence of dexamethasoneConclusionsThese findings suggest that under acutely challenging conditions depression is associated with greater resistance to molecules that normally terminate the inflammatory cascade An impaired capacity to regulate inflammation could underlie some of the excess morbidity and mortality that has been associated with depression
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder in children is a severe and a chronically disabling disorder This population appears to be a special group in terms of consequences of poor psychosocial and academic outcome and increased risk of substance abuse and suicide Studies have revealed several major findings in genetic familial psychological and biological aspects of such depression some of which have explored into the issue of its relationship with adult depression Considerable advances have been made now in the area of childhood depression providing a better understanding of its nature We review literature available on historical aspect epidemiology clinical characteristics and aetiology

clinical depression,PurposeThe aim of this study was to compare the precision of two different methods in detecting clinical depression in tumor patients the use of a screening questionnaire versus the assessment by health care providers nurses and doctorsMethodsDuring their first days of inpatient cancer treatment tumor patients were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM SCID Their physicians and nurses were asked to assess the mental health of the patients and their need for professional psychosocial support Additionally every patient completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADSResultsOut of patients were diagnosed with either a major or a minor depression
clinical depression,BackgroundPolygenic risk scores PRS for depression correlate with depression status and chronicity and provide causal anchors to identify depressive mechanisms Neuroticism is phenotypically and genetically positively associated with depression whereas psychological resilience demonstrates negative phenotypic associations Whether increased neuroticism and reduced resilience are downstream mediators of genetic risk for depression and whether they contribute independently to risk remains unknownMethodsModerating and mediating relationships between depression PRS neuroticism resilience and both clinical and selfreported depression were examined in a large populationbased cohort Generation Scotland Scottish Family Health Study N using linear regression and structural equation modelling Neuroticism and resilience were measured by
clinical depression,the Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form Revised and the Brief Resilience Scale respectivelyResultsPRS for depression was associated with increased likelihood of selfreported and clinical depression No interaction was found between PRS and neuroticism or between PRS and resilience Neuroticism was associated with increased likelihood of selfreported and clinical depression whereas resilience was associated with reduced risk Structural equation modelling suggested the association between PRS and selfreported and clinical depression was mediated by neuroticism while resilience mediated the association in the opposite direction For both selfreported and clinical diagnoses the genetic risk for depression was independently mediated by neuroticism and resilienceConclusionsFindings
clinical depression,How should DSM criteria relate to the disorders they are designed to assess To address this question empirically the author examines how well DSM symptomatic criteria for major depression capture the descriptions of clinical depression in the postKraepelin Western psychiatric tradition as described in textbooks published between 1900 and 1960 Eighteen symptoms and signs of depression were described of which are covered by the DSM criteria for major depression or melancholia For two symptoms mood and cognitive content DSM criteria are considerably narrower than those described in the textbooks Five symptoms and signs changes in volitionmotivation slowing of speech anxiety
clinical depression,other physical symptoms and depersonalizationderealization are not present in the DSM criteria Compared with the DSM criteria these authors gave greater emphasis to cognitive physical and psychomotor changes and less to neurovegetative symptoms These results suggest that important features of major depression are not captured by DSM criteria This is unproblematic as long as DSM criteria are understood to index rather than constitute psychiatric disorders However since DSMIII our field has moved toward a reification of DSM that implicitly assumes that psychiatric disorders are actually just the DSM criteria That is we have taken an index of something for the

clinical depression,Depression is common among athletes following sport injury yet few studies have explored the severity of postinjury depression Among those studies only one examined gender differences although women in the general population are more likely than men to experience depression No research to date has used interviews to assess depression despite their standard use among mental health professionals In a quasiexperimental design we used a selfreport checklist and a clinical interview to compare depression among male and female athletes at week month and months postinjury Results revealed significant effects of group injured vs control and time since injury and these
clinical depression,BackgroundWhile literature has suggested that the duration of a major depressive episode MDE may affect both symptomatic and functional outcomes in major depressive disorder MDD study designs are limited in their ability to isolate a causal relationshipMethodsA targeted literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE database to assess whether there was an association between shorter duration of an MDE or increased rapidity of symptom improvement and MDD outcomes in adult patients Given findings from the literature we hypothesized that rapid symptom improvement could be associated with other longerterm clinical outcomes and used a previouslydeveloped microsimulation model to test this hypothesis
clinical depression,The base case of the model replicated steptherapy treatment patterns for simulated patients based on lines of therapy related to standard of care observed remission rates and observed time to relapse from the STARD study In alternative scenario analyses the step remission rate was varied by and from the base case value to simulate the potential impact of improved earlier remission on disease trajectory and patientlevel clinical outcomesResultsThe literature review N studies suggests a statistically significant relationship between the duration of MDE or early symptom improvement and MDD outcomes The microsimulation model corroborated these findings and demonstrated that increasing the
clinical depression,rate of remission in step results in patients experiencing decreased number of treatment steps faster time to remission decreased rate of reaching treatmentresistant depression and delayed time to relapseLimitationsRates of relapse in STARD were deemed unreliable due to the highloss of followup rates of relapse for the MDD DTM were instead derived using parametric extrapolation methods ie exponential Weibull loglogistic Gaussian lognormal logistic Adherence to treatment was assumed to be however nonadherence is expected to result in lower cumulative remission ratesConclusionFindings from the literature coupled with quantification through a novel microsimulation model demonstrate the potential impact of increased remission on
clinical depression,BackgroundDepression has been associated with increased oxidative stress and hypothesized to accelerate aging Nucleic acid damage from oxidation is a critical part of the aging process and a suggested early event in agerelated somatic morbidities that are also prevalent in depression such as dementia and type diabetes We hypothesized that increased severity of depression is associated with increased systemic oxidatively generated DNA and RNA damage and that this increase is attenuated by an effective antidepressant treatmentMethodsThe urinary excretion of markers of systemic oxidatively generated DNA and RNA damage oxodihydrodeoxyguanosine oxodG and oxodihydroguanosine oxoGuo respectively were determined in healthy controls N

clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with different levels of severity and impairment on the personal functioning for each patient Classification systems in psychiatry including ICD and DSM are used by clinicians in order to simplify the complexity of clinical manifestations In particular the DSM introduced specifiers subtypes severity ratings and crosscutting symptom assessments allowing clinicians to better describe the specific clinical features of each patient However the use of DSM specifiers for major depressive disorder in ordinary clinical practice is quite heterogeneous The present study using a Delphi method aims to evaluate the consensus of a

clinical depression,Major depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating personal and public health conditions worldwide Less appreciated is that depressions tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives whereas half or more will never have a recurrence Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depressions first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory The lack of recognition of this

clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD
clinical depression,Purpose of reviewWe give an overview of recent developments on psychological treatments of depression in primary careRecent findingsIn recent years it has become clear that psychotherapies can effectively be delivered through ehealth applications Furthermore several studies in low and middle income countries have shown that lay health counselors can effectively deliver psychological therapies Behavioral activation a relatively simple form of therapy has been found to be as effective as cognitive behavior therapy Treatment of subthreshold depression has been found to not only reduce depressive symptoms but also prevent the onset of major depression In addition therapies are effective in older
clinical depression,BackgroundBurnout and clinical depression have been variably viewed as synonymous or as distinctly differing entities but with few distinguishing features provided Failure to differentiate the two conditions can lead to compromised clinical management We sought to enhance the differentiation of burnout and clinical depression by assembling a list of candidate differentiating featuresMethodsIn assembling a set of distinguishing clinical features we compared burnout states against the two principal depressive subtypes ie melancholic and nonmelancholic depression rather than against major depression per se Our candidate features were assembled from a review of salient literature our clinical observations and from a subsample of
clinical depression,The interaction of physical and mental vulnerability and environmental constraints is thought to foster the development of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD A central factor in the development of psychopathology is mental stress Despite some evidence for parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity in MDD the psychophysiological response to stress in depression is not clearcut Given the growing interest in heart rate and heart rate variability as indicators for remote monitoring of patients it is important to understand how patients with MDD react to stress in a laboratorycontrolled environment We conducted a systematic review of studies using electrocardiography
clinical depression,to derive heart rate and heart rate variability during stress in patients with clinical depression We focused on wellvalidated stress tasks the mental arithmetic stress task the Trier social stress task and public speaking task to minimize confounding effects due to the nature of the stressor The majority of studies found hyporeactivity during stress as a hallmark of depression as evidenced by lower fluctuation in heart rate and heart rate variability in the highfrequency band We address the potential underlying biological mechanisms the influence of covariates on these measures and briefly discuss the specificity and potential for remote monitoring by

clinical depression,In this Seminar we discuss developments from the past years in the diagnosis neurobiology and treatment of major depressive disorder For diagnosis psychiatric and medical comorbidity have been emphasised as important factors in improving the appropriate assessment and management of depression Advances in neurobiology have also increased and we aim to indicate genetic molecular and neuroimaging studies that are relevant for assessment and treatment selection of this disorder Further studies of depressionspecific psychotherapies the continued application of antidepressants the development of new treatment compounds and the status of new somatic treatments are also discussed We address two treatmentrelated issues suicide
clinical depression,Treatmentresistant depression TRD typically refers to inadequate response to at least one antidepressant trial of adequate doses and duration TRD is a relatively common occurrence in clinical practice with up to to of the patients not achieving adequate response following antidepressant treatment A diagnostic reevaluation is essential to the proper management of these patients In particular the potential role of several contributing factors such as medical and psychiatric comorbidity needs to be taken into account An accurate and systematic assessment of TRD is a challenge to both clinicians and researchers with the use of clinicianrated or selfrated instruments being perhaps
clinical depression,Major Depressive Disorder MDD is common among cancer patients with prevalence rates up to fourtimes higher than the general population Depression confers worse outcomes including nonadherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression Moreover psychosocial stressors in cancer promote inflammation and oxidativenitrosative stress a decreased immunosurveillance and a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous system and of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis Consequently the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms
clinical depression,Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder MDD with deficits observed across several domains eg executive function memory attention While depression alone is disabling patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments poorer clinical recovery and reduced quality of life Consequently it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD Areas covered This review spans psychological physical and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression Where possible the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains eg attention and highlight the differential
clinical depression,Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression but despite advances in pharmacological therapies many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response even after treatments with several medications As such there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient Areas covered This review examines the recent findings coming from different omic sciences in human bloodbased biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on geneticepigenetic and biochemical biomarkers Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity
clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing
clinical depression,normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad other specified bipolar and related disorders New specifiers of MDD with anxious distress and with mixed features allow
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly

bipolar disorder,ObjectiveBipolar disorder is a multifaceted illness and there is often a substantial delay between the first onset of symptoms and diagnosis Early detection has the potential to curtail illness progression and disorderassociated burden but it requires a clear understanding of the initial bipolar prodrome This article summarizes the phenomenology of bipolar disorder with an emphasis on the initial prodrome the evolution of the illness and the implications for prevention and early interventionMethodsA literature review was undertaken using Medline Web of Science and a hand search of relevant literature using keywords eg phenomenology initial or early symptoms risk factors and predictorsprediction
bipolar disorder,Findings from the literature were reviewed and synthesized and have been put into a clinical contextResultsBipolar disorder is a recurrent persistent and disabling illness that typically develops in adolescence or early adulthood The literature search yielded articles in which mood lability nonspecific nonmood symptoms and cyclothymic temperament were the most cited prodromal featuresConclusionsA small number of key prospective studies have provided evidence in support of an initial bipolar prodrome however methodological differences across studies have prohibited its clear delineation It is therefore not currently possible to anticipate those who will develop bipolar disorder solely on the basis of early phenomenology
bipolar disorder,Although there is a broad base of literature on depression among elderly patients and on mania in younger patients there is a relative paucity of information on bipolar disorder in the elderly population While the quantities of data reflect the relative prevalences of these illnesses there is evidence to suggest that classification of mania in the elderly with respect to age of onset natural course family history and pathophysiology may be useful in understanding the heterogeneous etiologies of this syndrome This paper presents a review of the literature on the incidence and course of illness in latelife bipolar disorder Further
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder has not been well studied in prepubertal children despite its potentially debilitating effects on growth and development However there have been case reports of mania in this age group dating back to Esquirol in the mid19th century Despite anecdotal case reports explicit criteria to diagnose mania in children were not used until 1960 Since 1980 the DSMIIIDSMIIIR criteria have indicated adult criteria can be used to diagnose childhood mania with some modifications to adjust for age differences Bipolar disorder has not been frequently considered in the psychiatric differential diagnosis of children However if a diagnosis of mania is

bipolar disorder,The authors provide an overview of the diagnosis course and treatment of bipolar II disorder a distinct subtype that is often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression or bipolar I disorder They discuss research suggesting that underdiagnosis of bipolar II disorder reflects a failure to identify subthreshold expression of mania hypomania The course of bipolar II disorder is different from that of bipolar I disorder or unipolar depression with distinct differences in rates of recovery clinical features and number of episodes The risk of suicide appears to be particularly elevated High rates of comorbid disorders have been reported including substance abuse or
bipolar disorder,Bipolar II disorder BPII is defined by DSMIV as recurrent episodes of depression and hypomania Hypomania according to DSMIV requires elevated euphoric andor irritable mood plus at least three of the following symptoms four if mood is only irritable grandiosity decreased need for sleep increased talking racing thoughts distractibility overactivity an increase in goaldirected activity psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in risky activities This observable change in functioning should not be severe enough to cause marked impairment of social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalisation The distinction between BPII and bipolar I disorder BPI is not clearcut The symptoms
bipolar disorder,of mania defining BPI and hypomania defining BPII are the same apart from the presence of psychosis in mania and the distinction is based on the presence of marked impairment associated with mania ie mania is more severe and may require hospitalisation This is an unclear boundary that can lead to misclassification however the fact that hypomania often increases functioning makes the distinction between mania and hypomania clearer BPII depression can be syndromal and subsyndromal and it is the prominent feature of BPII It is often a mixed depression ie it has concurrent usually subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms It is the
bipolar disorder,depression that usually leads the patient to seek treatmentDSMIV bipolar disorders BPI BPII cyclothymic disorder and bipolar disorder not otherwise classified which includes very rapid cycling and recurrent hypomania are now considered to be part of the bipolar spectrum This is not included in DSMIV but is thought to also include antidepressantsubstanceassociated hypomania cyclothymic temperament a trait of highly unstable mood thinking and behaviour unipolar mixed depression and highly recurrent unipolar depressionBPII is underdiagnosed in clinical practice and its pharmacological treatment is understudied Underdiagnosis is demonstrated by recent epidemiological studies While in DSMIV BPII is reported to have a lifetime
bipolar disorder,community prevalence of epidemiological studies have instead found that it has a lifetime community prevalence including the bipolar spectrum of around In depressed outpatients one in two may have BPII The recent increased diagnosing of BPII in research settings is related to several factors including the introduction of the use of semistructured interviews by trained research clinicians a relaxation of diagnostic criteria such that the minimum duration of hypomania is now less than the days stipulated by DSMIV and a probing for a history of hypomania focused more on overactivity increased goaldirected activity than on mood change although this is
bipolar disorder,still required for a diagnosis of hypomania Guidelines on the treatment of BPII are mainly consensus based and tend to follow those for the treatment of BPI because there have been few controlled studies of the treatment of BPII The current limited evidence supports the following lines of treatment for BPII Hypomania is likely to respond to the same agents useful for mania ie moodstabilising agents such as lithium and valproate and the secondgeneration antipsychotics ie olanzapine quetiapine risperidone ziprasidone aripiprazole Hypomania should be treated even if associated with overfunctioning because a depression often soon follows hypomania the hypomaniadepression cycle
bipolar disorder,For the treatment of acute BPII depression two controlled studies of quetiapine have not found clearcut positive effects Naturalistic studies although open to several biases have found antidepressants in acute BPII depression to be as effective as in unipolar depression however one recent large controlled study mainly in patients with BPI has found antidepressants to be no more effective than placebo Results from naturalistic studies and clinical observations on mixed depression while in need of replication in controlled studies indicate that antidepressants may worsen the concurrent intradepression hypomanic symptoms The only preventive treatment for both depression and hypomania that is

bipolar disorder,DSMIV subcategorises bipolar disorders into type type and a third not otherwise specified NOS category Although previous works suggest that these subtypes remain reasonably stable over time it is unclear if subdiagnoses endure over time or if patients are commonly recategorized within the spectrum in a realworld clinical setting We assessed subdiagnostic stability in individuals with bipolar disorder using data from the Swedish national quality assurance register for bipolar disorders BipolR Diagnoses at baseline registration that could occur at any time point during the course of illness were compared with diagnoses at followup registration years later Changes in subdiagnoses were
bipolar disorder,analysed in relation to clinical setting diagnostic procedure and patient features We found that and of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder type type and NOS respectively retained the same subdiagnosis at the year followup The following factors were associated with higher rate of subdiagnostic transitions previous suicide attempts unemployment or low psychosocial function treatment with antidepressants and comorbid anxiety neuropsychiatric or personality disorder Conversely use and duration of mood stabilizer treatment the use of structured diagnostic instruments and treatment at an outpatient unit specialized in managing affective disorders were associated with lower likelihood of subdiagnostic transitions Our findings confirm that

bipolar disorder,key components of neurocognition in particular psychomotor speed verbal memory and verbal fluency Notably it has a sophisticated neurocognitive profile such that while lithium impairs neurocognition across some domains it seemingly preserves others possibly those vulnerable to the effects of bipolar disorder Furthermore its effects are likely to be direct and indirect via mood for example and cumulative with duration of treatment Disentangling the components of neurocognition modulated by lithium in the context of a fluctuating and complex illness such as bipolar disorder is a significant challenge but one that therefore demands a stratified and systematic approach such as that

bipolar disorder,The debate regarding the possible existence of prepubertal bipolar illness has surfaced at various points in history In its most recent incarnation proponents of a childhood bipolar diagnosis argue that there is an earlyonset form of bipolar illness that is highly comorbid and characterized by simultaneous irritability and depression Others have suggested that childhood manic symptoms are more likely a nonspecific indicator of risk or may be the result of symptom overlap with various other forms of childhood pathology This article briefly reviews pertinent findings from epidemiologic developmental family and treatment studies that shed light on the etiology phenomenology and
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BD is a severe psychiatric illness with an increasing prevalence worldwide Although the pathological mechanism of and pharmacological interventions for BD have been extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies a scientometric analysis of the developmental trends interdisciplinary frontiers and research hotspots in this field has not yet been conducted Therefore we performed a comprehensive scientometric review of published studies on BD over the past two decades 20022021 to identify the most frequently used keywords and explore research hotspots and trajectories The present findings revealed the main distribution knowledge structure topic evolution and emerging topics of BD research
bipolar disorder,Borderline personality disorder BPD and bipolar disorder types I and II are frequently confused because of their symptomatic overlap Although affective instability is a prominent feature of each the pattern is entirely different BPD is characterized by transient mood shifts that occur in response to interpersonal stressors whereas bipolar disorder is associated with sustained mood changes These disorders can be further distinguished by comparing their phenomenology etiology family history biological studies outcome and response to medication Their distinction is of great clinical importance because misdiagnosis can deprive the patient of potentially effective treatment whether it is psychotherapy for BPD or
bipolar disorder,BackgroundBipolar disorder heterogeneity is large leading to difficulties in identifying neuropathophysiological and etiological mechanisms and hindering the formation of clinically homogeneous patient groups in clinical trials Identifying markers of clinically more homogeneous groups would help disentangle BD heterogeneity Neuroimaging may aid in identifying such groups by highlighting specific biomarkers of BD subtypes or clinical dimensionsMethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of the neuroimaging literature assessing biomarkers of relevant BD phenotypes typeI vs II presence vs absence of psychotic features suicidal behavior and impulsivity rapid cycling good vs poor medication response age at onset cognitive performance and circadian abnormalitiesResultsConsistent biomarkers were
bipolar disorder,The authors provide an overview of the diagnosis course and treatment of bipolar II disorder a distinct subtype that is often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression or bipolar I disorder They discuss research suggesting that underdiagnosis of bipolar II disorder reflects a failure to identify subthreshold expression of mania hypomania The course of bipolar II disorder is different from that of bipolar I disorder or unipolar depression with distinct differences in rates of recovery clinical features and number of episodes The risk of suicide appears to be particularly elevated High rates of comorbid disorders have been reported including substance abuse or
bipolar disorder,Bipolar II disorder BPII is defined by DSMIV as recurrent episodes of depression and hypomania Hypomania according to DSMIV requires elevated euphoric andor irritable mood plus at least three of the following symptoms four if mood is only irritable grandiosity decreased need for sleep increased talking racing thoughts distractibility overactivity an increase in goaldirected activity psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in risky activities This observable change in functioning should not be severe enough to cause marked impairment of social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalisation The distinction between BPII and bipolar I disorder BPI is not clearcut The symptoms
bipolar disorder,of mania defining BPI and hypomania defining BPII are the same apart from the presence of psychosis in mania and the distinction is based on the presence of marked impairment associated with mania ie mania is more severe and may require hospitalisation This is an unclear boundary that can lead to misclassification however the fact that hypomania often increases functioning makes the distinction between mania and hypomania clearer BPII depression can be syndromal and subsyndromal and it is the prominent feature of BPII It is often a mixed depression ie it has concurrent usually subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms It is the
bipolar disorder,depression that usually leads the patient to seek treatmentDSMIV bipolar disorders BPI BPII cyclothymic disorder and bipolar disorder not otherwise classified which includes very rapid cycling and recurrent hypomania are now considered to be part of the bipolar spectrum This is not included in DSMIV but is thought to also include antidepressantsubstanceassociated hypomania cyclothymic temperament a trait of highly unstable mood thinking and behaviour unipolar mixed depression and highly recurrent unipolar depressionBPII is underdiagnosed in clinical practice and its pharmacological treatment is understudied Underdiagnosis is demonstrated by recent epidemiological studies While in DSMIV BPII is reported to have a lifetime
bipolar disorder,community prevalence of epidemiological studies have instead found that it has a lifetime community prevalence including the bipolar spectrum of around In depressed outpatients one in two may have BPII The recent increased diagnosing of BPII in research settings is related to several factors including the introduction of the use of semistructured interviews by trained research clinicians a relaxation of diagnostic criteria such that the minimum duration of hypomania is now less than the days stipulated by DSMIV and a probing for a history of hypomania focused more on overactivity increased goaldirected activity than on mood change although this is
bipolar disorder,still required for a diagnosis of hypomania Guidelines on the treatment of BPII are mainly consensus based and tend to follow those for the treatment of BPI because there have been few controlled studies of the treatment of BPII The current limited evidence supports the following lines of treatment for BPII Hypomania is likely to respond to the same agents useful for mania ie moodstabilising agents such as lithium and valproate and the secondgeneration antipsychotics ie olanzapine quetiapine risperidone ziprasidone aripiprazole Hypomania should be treated even if associated with overfunctioning because a depression often soon follows hypomania the hypomaniadepression cycle
bipolar disorder,For the treatment of acute BPII depression two controlled studies of quetiapine have not found clearcut positive effects Naturalistic studies although open to several biases have found antidepressants in acute BPII depression to be as effective as in unipolar depression however one recent large controlled study mainly in patients with BPI has found antidepressants to be no more effective than placebo Results from naturalistic studies and clinical observations on mixed depression while in need of replication in controlled studies indicate that antidepressants may worsen the concurrent intradepression hypomanic symptoms The only preventive treatment for both depression and hypomania that is

bipolar disorder,IntroductionA growing body of evidence suggests that bipolar disorder BD is a progressive disease according to clinical biochemical and neuroimaging findings This study reviewed the literature on the relationship between specific biomarkers and BD stagesMethodsA comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed was conducted to identify studies in English and Portuguese using the keywords biomarker neurotrophic factors inflammation oxidative stress neuroprogression and staging models crossreferenced with bipolar disorderResultsMorphometric studies of patients with BD found neuroanatomic abnormalities such as ventricular enlargement grey matter loss in the hippocampus and cerebellum volume decreases in the prefrontal cortex and variations in the size of
bipolar disorder,DSMIV subcategorises bipolar disorders into type type and a third not otherwise specified NOS category Although previous works suggest that these subtypes remain reasonably stable over time it is unclear if subdiagnoses endure over time or if patients are commonly recategorized within the spectrum in a realworld clinical setting We assessed subdiagnostic stability in individuals with bipolar disorder using data from the Swedish national quality assurance register for bipolar disorders BipolR Diagnoses at baseline registration that could occur at any time point during the course of illness were compared with diagnoses at followup registration years later Changes in subdiagnoses were
bipolar disorder,analysed in relation to clinical setting diagnostic procedure and patient features We found that and of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder type type and NOS respectively retained the same subdiagnosis at the year followup The following factors were associated with higher rate of subdiagnostic transitions previous suicide attempts unemployment or low psychosocial function treatment with antidepressants and comorbid anxiety neuropsychiatric or personality disorder Conversely use and duration of mood stabilizer treatment the use of structured diagnostic instruments and treatment at an outpatient unit specialized in managing affective disorders were associated with lower likelihood of subdiagnostic transitions Our findings confirm that

bipolar disorder,Although awareness on bipolar disorder has increased during the last decade this condition remains characterized by a disabling burden in terms of morbidity and functional impairment This paper aims to review some critical issues in the current knowledge on Bipolar disorder Although large European epidemiological studies are lacking Bipolar disorder is characterized by a set of severe features including an early age of onset a chronic outcome and an important suicidal risk A majority of bipolar patients also experience a comorbid Axis I condition including substance abuse anxiety disorder and attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder This situation presents a therapeutic challenge since
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to characterize the neurocognitive effects of lithium in bipolar disorder to inform clinical and research approaches for further investigationMethodsKey words pertaining to neurocognition in bipolar disorder and lithium treatment were used to search recognized databases to identify relevant literature The authors also retrieved gray literature eg book chapters known to them and examined pertinent articles from bibliographiesResultsA limited number of studies have examined the effects of lithium on neurocognition in bipolar disorder and although in some domains a consistent picture emerges in many domains the findings are mixed Lithium administration appears to reshape
bipolar disorder,key components of neurocognition in particular psychomotor speed verbal memory and verbal fluency Notably it has a sophisticated neurocognitive profile such that while lithium impairs neurocognition across some domains it seemingly preserves others possibly those vulnerable to the effects of bipolar disorder Furthermore its effects are likely to be direct and indirect via mood for example and cumulative with duration of treatment Disentangling the components of neurocognition modulated by lithium in the context of a fluctuating and complex illness such as bipolar disorder is a significant challenge but one that therefore demands a stratified and systematic approach such as that
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is an affective or mood disorder that affects children and adolescents as well as adults Originally thought to be rare in childhood this disorder is now diagnosed even in the prepubertal age group With pediatricians providing health care for the majority of children and adolescents these physicians will see the children early in their presentation with affective disorder This review focuses on the early recognition of children with bipolar disorder or children who are at increased risk of developing mania Early recognition can lead to early treatment and reduce both short and longterm morbidity and mortality This review
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a multifactorial psychiatric disorder with developmental and progressive neurophysiological alterations This disorder is typically characterized by cyclical and recurrent episodes of mania and depression but is heterogeneous in its clinical presentation and outcome Although the DSMIVTR criteria identify several features that are of phenomenological relevance these are of less utility for defining homogeneous subgroups for analyses of correlations with biomarkers or for directing focused medication strategies We provide a comprehensive review of existing evidence regarding to age at onset in bipolar disorder Eight admixture studies demonstrate three homogeneous subgroups of patients with bipolar disorder identified according to
bipolar disorder,age at onset early intermediate and late age at onset with two cutoff points at and years It is suggested that the earlyonset subgroup has specific clinical features and outcomes different from those of the other subgroups Earlyonset subgroup may be considered a more suitable clinical phenotype for the identification of susceptibility genes with recent data demonstrating associations with genetic variants specifically in this subgroup The use of age at onset as a specifier may also facilitate the identification of other biological markers for use in brain imaging circadian inflammatory and cognitive research A key challenge is posed by the

bipolar disorder,Bipolar manicdepressive disorder is a common and severe illness It is also potentially fatal as a result of accidents and increased mortality associated with comorbid substance use and medical illnesses but its highest lethality results from suicide Suicide rates averaging per year in men and women diagnosed with bipolar disorder are fold higher than in the general population Suicidal acts often occur early in the illness course and in association with severe depressive and dysphoricagitated mixed phases of illness especially following repeated severe depressions Systematic consideration of risk and protective factors enhances assessment of potentially suicidal patients Shortterm interventions employed
bipolar disorder,empirically to manage acute suicidality include close clinical supervision rapid hospitalisation and use of electroconvulsive treatment Several plausible therapeutic interventions have limited evidence of longterm effectiveness against mortality risks associated with any psychiatric disorder including antidepressant antimanic antipsychotic and electroconvulsive as well as psychosocial treatments However in bipolar disorder and other major affective disorders lithium maintenance treatment is a notable exception with strong and consistent evidence that it reduces suicidal risk The growing range of drugs being introduced to treat acute and longterm phases of bipolar disorder including antiepileptic drugs atypical antipsychotics and relatively safe modern antidepressants require research assessment

bipolar disorder,ObjectiveBipolar affective disorder runs a natural course of frequent relapses and recurrences Despite significant strides in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder most bipolar patients cannot be treated only by drugs The limitations of using medication alone in symptomatic relapse prevention and satisfactionquality of life terms have long prompted interest in wider forms of management One of the promising way how to enhance remission seems to be combination of pharmacotherapy and psychoeducationMethodsStudies were identified through PUBMED Web of Science and Scopus databases as well as existing reviews The search terms included bipolar disorder psychoeducation psychotherapy psychosocial treatment family therapy individual
bipolar disorder,therapy group therapy and psychoeducation The search was performed by repeated use of the words in different combinations with no language or time limitations This article is a review with conclusions concerned with psychoeducation in bipolar disorderConclusionsRandomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioral therapy interpersonal and social rhythm therapy individual group and family psychoeducation show that these approaches augment stabilizing effect of pharmacotherapy Patients and their families should be educated about bipolar disorder triggers warning signs mood relapse suicidal ideation and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications Psychosocial approaches are important therapeutic strategies for reducing relapse and rehospitalization in
bipolar disorder,The debate regarding the possible existence of prepubertal bipolar illness has surfaced at various points in history In its most recent incarnation proponents of a childhood bipolar diagnosis argue that there is an earlyonset form of bipolar illness that is highly comorbid and characterized by simultaneous irritability and depression Others have suggested that childhood manic symptoms are more likely a nonspecific indicator of risk or may be the result of symptom overlap with various other forms of childhood pathology This article briefly reviews pertinent findings from epidemiologic developmental family and treatment studies that shed light on the etiology phenomenology and
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BD is a severe psychiatric illness with an increasing prevalence worldwide Although the pathological mechanism of and pharmacological interventions for BD have been extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies a scientometric analysis of the developmental trends interdisciplinary frontiers and research hotspots in this field has not yet been conducted Therefore we performed a comprehensive scientometric review of published studies on BD over the past two decades 20022021 to identify the most frequently used keywords and explore research hotspots and trajectories The present findings revealed the main distribution knowledge structure topic evolution and emerging topics of BD research
bipolar disorder,Borderline personality disorder BPD and bipolar disorder types I and II are frequently confused because of their symptomatic overlap Although affective instability is a prominent feature of each the pattern is entirely different BPD is characterized by transient mood shifts that occur in response to interpersonal stressors whereas bipolar disorder is associated with sustained mood changes These disorders can be further distinguished by comparing their phenomenology etiology family history biological studies outcome and response to medication Their distinction is of great clinical importance because misdiagnosis can deprive the patient of potentially effective treatment whether it is psychotherapy for BPD or
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a pathological disturbance of mood characterized by waxing and waning manic depressive and sometimes distinctly mixed states A diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made with certainty when the manic syndrome declares itself Most individuals who are diagnosed with this disorder will experience both poles of the illness recurrently but depressive episodes are the commonest cause of morbidity and indeed of death by suicide Twin adoption and epidemiological studies suggest a strongly genetic aetiology It is a genetically and phenotypically complex disorder Thus the genes contributing are likely to be numerous and of small effect Individuals
bipolar disorder,with bipolar disorder also display deficits on a range of neuropsychological tasks in both the acute and euthymic phases of illness and correlations between number of affective episodes experienced and task performance are commonly reported Current selfreport and observerrated scales are optimized for unipolar depression and hence limited in their ability to accurately assess bipolar depression The development of a specific depression rating scale will improve the assessment of bipolar depression in both research and clinical settings It will improve the development of better treatments and interventions Guidelines support the use of antidepressants for bipolar depression With regard to the
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveBipolar disorder is a multifaceted illness and there is often a substantial delay between the first onset of symptoms and diagnosis Early detection has the potential to curtail illness progression and disorderassociated burden but it requires a clear understanding of the initial bipolar prodrome This article summarizes the phenomenology of bipolar disorder with an emphasis on the initial prodrome the evolution of the illness and the implications for prevention and early interventionMethodsA literature review was undertaken using Medline Web of Science and a hand search of relevant literature using keywords eg phenomenology initial or early symptoms risk factors and predictorsprediction
bipolar disorder,Findings from the literature were reviewed and synthesized and have been put into a clinical contextResultsBipolar disorder is a recurrent persistent and disabling illness that typically develops in adolescence or early adulthood The literature search yielded articles in which mood lability nonspecific nonmood symptoms and cyclothymic temperament were the most cited prodromal featuresConclusionsA small number of key prospective studies have provided evidence in support of an initial bipolar prodrome however methodological differences across studies have prohibited its clear delineation It is therefore not currently possible to anticipate those who will develop bipolar disorder solely on the basis of early phenomenology
bipolar disorder,Although there is a broad base of literature on depression among elderly patients and on mania in younger patients there is a relative paucity of information on bipolar disorder in the elderly population While the quantities of data reflect the relative prevalences of these illnesses there is evidence to suggest that classification of mania in the elderly with respect to age of onset natural course family history and pathophysiology may be useful in understanding the heterogeneous etiologies of this syndrome This paper presents a review of the literature on the incidence and course of illness in latelife bipolar disorder Further
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder has not been well studied in prepubertal children despite its potentially debilitating effects on growth and development However there have been case reports of mania in this age group dating back to Esquirol in the mid19th century Despite anecdotal case reports explicit criteria to diagnose mania in children were not used until 1960 Since 1980 the DSMIIIDSMIIIR criteria have indicated adult criteria can be used to diagnose childhood mania with some modifications to adjust for age differences Bipolar disorder has not been frequently considered in the psychiatric differential diagnosis of children However if a diagnosis of mania is

bipolar disorder,ObjectiveRecent research on the epidemiology clinical course diagnosis and treatment of bipolar II disorder BD II stands to have a considerable impact on clinical practice This paper reviews these developmentsMethodWe conducted a Pubmed search focusing on the period from January 1994 to August 2004 Articles deemed directly relevant to the epidemiology course diagnosis and management of BD II were consideredResultsThe prevalence of BD II is likely higher than previously suggested Systematic probing for particular clinical features and use of screening tools allow for a more timely and accurate detection of the disorder There is a paucity of good quality data
bipolar disorder,The authors provide an overview of the diagnosis course and treatment of bipolar II disorder a distinct subtype that is often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression or bipolar I disorder They discuss research suggesting that underdiagnosis of bipolar II disorder reflects a failure to identify subthreshold expression of mania hypomania The course of bipolar II disorder is different from that of bipolar I disorder or unipolar depression with distinct differences in rates of recovery clinical features and number of episodes The risk of suicide appears to be particularly elevated High rates of comorbid disorders have been reported including substance abuse or
bipolar disorder,Bipolar II disorder BPII is defined by DSMIV as recurrent episodes of depression and hypomania Hypomania according to DSMIV requires elevated euphoric andor irritable mood plus at least three of the following symptoms four if mood is only irritable grandiosity decreased need for sleep increased talking racing thoughts distractibility overactivity an increase in goaldirected activity psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in risky activities This observable change in functioning should not be severe enough to cause marked impairment of social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalisation The distinction between BPII and bipolar I disorder BPI is not clearcut The symptoms
bipolar disorder,of mania defining BPI and hypomania defining BPII are the same apart from the presence of psychosis in mania and the distinction is based on the presence of marked impairment associated with mania ie mania is more severe and may require hospitalisation This is an unclear boundary that can lead to misclassification however the fact that hypomania often increases functioning makes the distinction between mania and hypomania clearer BPII depression can be syndromal and subsyndromal and it is the prominent feature of BPII It is often a mixed depression ie it has concurrent usually subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms It is the
bipolar disorder,depression that usually leads the patient to seek treatmentDSMIV bipolar disorders BPI BPII cyclothymic disorder and bipolar disorder not otherwise classified which includes very rapid cycling and recurrent hypomania are now considered to be part of the bipolar spectrum This is not included in DSMIV but is thought to also include antidepressantsubstanceassociated hypomania cyclothymic temperament a trait of highly unstable mood thinking and behaviour unipolar mixed depression and highly recurrent unipolar depressionBPII is underdiagnosed in clinical practice and its pharmacological treatment is understudied Underdiagnosis is demonstrated by recent epidemiological studies While in DSMIV BPII is reported to have a lifetime
bipolar disorder,community prevalence of epidemiological studies have instead found that it has a lifetime community prevalence including the bipolar spectrum of around In depressed outpatients one in two may have BPII The recent increased diagnosing of BPII in research settings is related to several factors including the introduction of the use of semistructured interviews by trained research clinicians a relaxation of diagnostic criteria such that the minimum duration of hypomania is now less than the days stipulated by DSMIV and a probing for a history of hypomania focused more on overactivity increased goaldirected activity than on mood change although this is
bipolar disorder,still required for a diagnosis of hypomania Guidelines on the treatment of BPII are mainly consensus based and tend to follow those for the treatment of BPI because there have been few controlled studies of the treatment of BPII The current limited evidence supports the following lines of treatment for BPII Hypomania is likely to respond to the same agents useful for mania ie moodstabilising agents such as lithium and valproate and the secondgeneration antipsychotics ie olanzapine quetiapine risperidone ziprasidone aripiprazole Hypomania should be treated even if associated with overfunctioning because a depression often soon follows hypomania the hypomaniadepression cycle
bipolar disorder,For the treatment of acute BPII depression two controlled studies of quetiapine have not found clearcut positive effects Naturalistic studies although open to several biases have found antidepressants in acute BPII depression to be as effective as in unipolar depression however one recent large controlled study mainly in patients with BPI has found antidepressants to be no more effective than placebo Results from naturalistic studies and clinical observations on mixed depression while in need of replication in controlled studies indicate that antidepressants may worsen the concurrent intradepression hypomanic symptoms The only preventive treatment for both depression and hypomania that is
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a relatively common condition characterised by recurrent episodes of mania and depression and associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality Although there have been substantial advances in the pharmacotherapeutics of this condition over the last years the benefits have been predominantly in terms of tolerability and safety with no new treatments being demonstrated to be more effective than lithiumthe prototype mood stabiliser This article reviews current and emerging medications for bipolar disorder Most of the emerging treatments in pharmaceutical industry developmental programmes are new or modified anticonvulsants or atypical antipsychotics A number of possible future directions
bipolar disorder,IntroductionA growing body of evidence suggests that bipolar disorder BD is a progressive disease according to clinical biochemical and neuroimaging findings This study reviewed the literature on the relationship between specific biomarkers and BD stagesMethodsA comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed was conducted to identify studies in English and Portuguese using the keywords biomarker neurotrophic factors inflammation oxidative stress neuroprogression and staging models crossreferenced with bipolar disorderResultsMorphometric studies of patients with BD found neuroanatomic abnormalities such as ventricular enlargement grey matter loss in the hippocampus and cerebellum volume decreases in the prefrontal cortex and variations in the size of
bipolar disorder,DSMIV subcategorises bipolar disorders into type type and a third not otherwise specified NOS category Although previous works suggest that these subtypes remain reasonably stable over time it is unclear if subdiagnoses endure over time or if patients are commonly recategorized within the spectrum in a realworld clinical setting We assessed subdiagnostic stability in individuals with bipolar disorder using data from the Swedish national quality assurance register for bipolar disorders BipolR Diagnoses at baseline registration that could occur at any time point during the course of illness were compared with diagnoses at followup registration years later Changes in subdiagnoses were
bipolar disorder,analysed in relation to clinical setting diagnostic procedure and patient features We found that and of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder type type and NOS respectively retained the same subdiagnosis at the year followup The following factors were associated with higher rate of subdiagnostic transitions previous suicide attempts unemployment or low psychosocial function treatment with antidepressants and comorbid anxiety neuropsychiatric or personality disorder Conversely use and duration of mood stabilizer treatment the use of structured diagnostic instruments and treatment at an outpatient unit specialized in managing affective disorders were associated with lower likelihood of subdiagnostic transitions Our findings confirm that

bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is an affective or mood disorder that affects children and adolescents as well as adults Originally thought to be rare in childhood this disorder is now diagnosed even in the prepubertal age group With pediatricians providing health care for the majority of children and adolescents these physicians will see the children early in their presentation with affective disorder This review focuses on the early recognition of children with bipolar disorder or children who are at increased risk of developing mania Early recognition can lead to early treatment and reduce both short and longterm morbidity and mortality This review

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesA number of staging models have been generated for the bipolar disorders which include preonset as well as postonset stages Some models propose treatments for those at the preonset stage a recommendation which is critiqued hereMethodsSeveral exemplar staging models are overviewed and a critique is providedResultsThe critique argues against intervention at a preonset stage in light of there being limited risk factors unquantified sensitivity and specificity data for most putative onset illness risk factors and thus there is the risk of overtreatment Also it is possible that many of the recommended interventions for those at risk of a bipolar disorder
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveTo describe clinical presentations of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents when they were diagnosedMaterial and methodThe present study was a retrospective chart review of patients who were diagnosed bipolar disorder when they were under years of age All subjects both inpatients and outpatients received psychiatric treatment at Ramathibodi hospital between January 1998 and May 2008ResultsFortynine subjects aged between eight and yearsold mean years were diagnosed as bipolar disorder Thirtyseven percent of patients had cardinal symptoms including elevated mood andor grandiosity Being talkative was the most common associated symptom found in of patients Psychotic symptoms were found in of patients
bipolar disorder,Once considered virtually nonexistent bipolar disorder in children has recently received a great deal of attention from mental health professionals and the general public This paper provides a current review of literature pertaining to the psychosocial treatment of children with earlyonset bipolar spectrum disorder EOBPSD Commencing with evidence of the emerging interest in this topic we then focus on terminology the rationale for studying EOBPSD in children current research and clinical progress possible explanations for the recent increase in recognition and essential issues that form the foundation of effective psychosocial treatment Next we explore areas of research with direct implications

bipolar disorder,a diagnosis of bipolar disorder Seventyfive patients who screened positive for bipolar disorder had a current major depressive episode or an anxiety or substance use disorder Of patients only reported taking a moodstabilizing agent in the past month Primary care physicians recorded evidence of current depression in patients who screened positive for bipolar disorder but did not record a bipolar disorder diagnosis either in administrative billing or the medical record of any of these patients Patients who screened positive for bipolar disorder reported worse healthrelated quality of life as well as increased social and family life impairment compared with those
bipolar disorder,Pediatric bipolar disorder once thought rare has gone through stages of conceptualization DSM criteria were reinterpreted such that children and adolescents particularly those with ADHD were commonly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and thought to be atypical by adult standards Research criteria separated pediatric bipolar patients into phenotypes including a research diagnosis of severe mood dysregulation DSM largely maintained previous criteria for bipolar disorder at all ages and created a new diagnosis called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder categorized as a depressive disorder for persistently angry or irritable patients with symptoms of childhood onset However the controversy regarding the diagnosis of pediatric
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorders constitute a group of frequent chronic psychiatric illnesses with a most severe impact on the patients life The course can be very individual and heterogeneous the best known and most frequent manifestations include the classical bipolar I and bipolar II disorders However in Germany even typical bipolar I disorders are underdiagnosed and consequently undertreated This is true despite the fact that the number of pharmacological treatment options has rapidly increased during recent years both in the field of anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics This supplies us today with new therapeutic strategies not only for acute mania but also for
bipolar disorder,This paper seeks to raise awareness of the impact and burden of bipolar depression and the need to improve its recognition and management in clinical practice Bipolar depression is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression and consequently patients may receive inappropriate treatment that could potentially worsen symptoms The Mood Disorder Questionnaire MDQ is a useful screening tool for identifying the range of bipolar spectrum disorders in general and psychiatric populations Bipolar depression has a significant impact on patients affecting work social activities family and friends Current treatments for bipolar disorder have focused on mania yet symptoms of bipolar depression occur more
bipolar disorder,IntroductionThe diagnostic boundaries between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are controversial due to the ambiguity of psychiatric nosology From this perspective it is noteworthy that formal thought disorder has historically been considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia Given that human thought is partially based on language we can hypothesize that alterations in language may help differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorderMethodIn this exploratory study we employed natural language processing techniques to identify differences in language abnormalities between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder The KoBERT and KoGPT language models were used to determine sentence acceptability assessing how natural and therefore acceptable a given
bipolar disorder,sentence is to the general population In addition semantic word networks were constructed for each group and network measures were comparedResultsPatients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder used less acceptable sentences than controlsPost hocanalysis revealed that the schizophrenia group used less acceptable sentences than the bipolar disorder group Furthermore the semantic word networks of the three groups were significantly different in the three network measuresPost hocanalysis revealed a significant difference between the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder networks The bipolar disorder network generally fell between the schizophrenia and control networks except in terms of the average clustering coefficientConclusionsPatients with schizophrenia and bipolar

bipolar disorder,depressive disorder unipolar depression bipolar depression is more likely to manifest with psychosis melancholic symptoms psychomotor retardation in bipolar I disorder and atypical symptoms The few neuropsychological studies undertaken indicate greater impairment in bipolar depression Suicide rates are high in bipolar disorder with suicidal ideation suicide attempts and completed suicides all occurring predominantly in the depressed phase of this condition Furthermore the depressed phase even subsyndromal appears to be the major contributant to the disability related to this conditionConclusionsThe significance of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder has been markedly underestimated Bipolar depression accounts for most of the morbidity and
bipolar disorder,Depressive phases are the most prevalent component of bipolar disorders even with modern treatment Bipolar depressive morbidity is often misdiagnosed and is limited in response to available treatments These conditions are especially debilitating and are associated with psychiatric comorbidity substance abuse functional disability and increased mortality owing to early suicide and accidents and later medical illnesses There is growing awareness that bipolar depression is one of the greatest challenges in modern psychiatry It is essential to differentiate various forms of depression dysthymia and dysphoric mixed states of bipolar disorders from the clinical features of more common unipolar major depressive disorders
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a recurrent highly disabling underrecognized and undertreated disease Our view upon bipolar disorder changed paradigmatically from a disorder formerly seen as a rather benign disease as compared to schizophrenia to a disease with inherent cognitive psychosocial and emotional disabilities going along with high suiciderates and high rates of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities The concept of a bipolar spectrum as represented by Jules Angst and Hagop Akiskal challenges current operationalized diagnostic criteria as exemplified by DSM and ICD This concept enlarges the prevalence of bipolar disorder from formerly to or more of the general population It seems even
bipolar disorder,BackgroundEpisode duration recurrence rates and time spent in manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder BD is not well defined for subtypes of the disorderMethodsWe reviewed the course timing and duration of episodes of mania and depression among clinically treated DSMIVTR BD patients of various types and compared duration and rates as well as total proportion of time in depressive versus manic episodes during average years at riskResultsAs expected episodes of depressions were much longer than manias but episodeduration did not differ among BD diagnostic types I II with mainly mixedepisodes BDMx or with psychotic features BDP Recurrence rates episodesyear
bipolar disorder,and proportion of time in depression and their ratios to mania were highest in BDII and BDMx subjects with more maniasyear in psychotic and BDI subjects In most BDsubtypes except with psychotic features there was more time in depressive than manic morbidity owing mainly to longer depressive than manic episodes The proportion of time in depression was highest among those who followed a predominant DMI course whereas total time in mania was greatest in BD with psychotic features and BDI and with an MDI courseConclusionsSubtypes of BD patients differed little in episodeduration which was consistently much longer for depression The
bipolar disorder,Over the last decade there has been a growing appreciation of the importance of identifying and treating cognitive impairment associated with bipolar disorder since it persists in remission periods Evidence indicates that neurocognitive dysfunction may significantly influence patients psychosocial outcomes An everincreasing body of research seeks to achieve a better understanding of potential moderators contributing to cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder in order to develop prevention strategies and effective treatments This review provides an overview of the available data from studies examining treatments for cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder as well as potential novel treatments from both pharmacological and psychological
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BD is a leading cause of global disability Its biological basis is unknown and its treatment unsatisfactory Here we review two recent areas of progress First the discovery of risk genes and their implications with a focus on voltagegated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target Second facilitated by new technologies it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes One such feature is persistent mood instability and efforts are underway to understand its mechanisms and its therapeutic potential
bipolar disorder,Characterized by the switch of manic and depressive phases bipolar disorder was described as early as the fifth century BC Nevertheless up to date the underlying neurobiology is still largely unclear assuming a multifactor genesis with both biologicalgenetic and psychosocial factors Significant process has been achieved in recent years in researching the causes of bipolar disorder with modern molecular biological eg genetic and epigenetic studies and imaging techniques eg positron emission tomography PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI In this chapter we will first summarize our recent knowledge on the etiology of bipolar disorder We then discuss how several
bipolar disorder,AimsThis article examines the ongoing debate concerning the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents This contentious issue has generated robust discussion over the past two decades without consensus and as such the true prevalence of socalled paediatric bipolar disorder PBD remains unknown In this article we offer a solution to break this deadlockMethodsRecent metaanalyses and additional literature concerning the definition and prevalence of PBD was critically reviewed with a view to understanding the perspectives of those developing the taxonomy of PBD and those engaged in research and clinical practiceResultsA key finding is the lack of iteration and meaningful
bipolar disorder,communication between the various groups interested in PBD that stems from deepseated problems within our classificatory systems This undermines our research efforts and complicates clinical practice These problems make the already difficult diagnosis of bipolar disorder in adults even more challenging to transpose to younger populations and additional complexities arise when parsing clinical phenomenology from normative developmental changes in youth Therefore in those manifesting bipolar symptoms postpuberty we argue for the use of adolescent bipolar disorder to describe bipolar symptoms whereas in prepubertal children we propose a reconceptualisation that allows symptomatic treatment to be advanced whilst requiring critical review of

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesPaediatric bipolar disorder bipolar disorder occurring in prepubertal children is a diagnosis subject to considerable controversy Whilst historically considered to be very rare proponents since the 1990s have argued that mania can present differently in children and as such is much more common than previously thought Such proposals raise questions about the validity of proposed phenotypes and potential risks of iatrogenic harmMethodsI critically examine the construct of paediatric bipolar disorder using Robins and Guzes 1970American Journal of Psychiatry126 influential criteria for the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis I review in turn evidence relating to its clinical description delimitation from other

bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BPD is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment Over the past decades BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis phenomenology and treatment of paediatric BPD The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum particularly among unaffected firstdegree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits This suggests a model in which large doses of risk variants cause illness but mild to moderate doses confer advantages which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population Bipolar disorder may thus

anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD and panic disorder PD are among the most common mental disorders in the United States and they can negatively impact a patients quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy The GAD and the Severity Measure for

anxiety disorder,Our understanding of social anxiety disorder also known as social phobia has moved from rudimentary awareness that it is not merely shyness to a much more sophisticated appreciation of its prevalence its chronic and pernicious nature and its neurobiological underpinnings Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder it has an early age of onsetby age years in about and by age years in about of individualsand it is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness and substance abuse Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder and genetic studies
anxiety disorder,Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD from an official recognition as a residual category in DSMIII has come a long way to be appreciated as a common underlying anxiety pathway in the literature Despite still being defined as extreme anxiety and worry upon performance and about ones health GAD seems to be a general umbrella of anxiety covering even social anxiety and panic disorder PD and even when not treated and chronic leading to major depressive disorder MDD Along the line of some other similar studies and contentions in the present study we sought to validate the hypothesis of GAD encompassing social

anxiety disorder,BackgroundThere is a lack of clarity regarding specific risk factors discriminating generalized anxiety disorder GAD from panic disorder PDGoalThis study investigated whether GAD and PD could be discriminated through differences in developmental etiological factors including childhood parental lossseparation psychological disorders and maternal and paternal attachmentMethodTwenty people with adult generalized anxiety disorder GAD with adult panic disorder PD with adult comorbid GAD and PD and adult nonanxious controls completed diagnostic interviews to assess symptoms of mental disorders in adulthood and childhood Participants also reported on parental attachment loss and separationResultsChildhood diagnoses of GAD and PD differentiated clinical groups from controls as
anxiety disorder,well as from each other suggesting greater likelihood for homotypic over heterotypic continuity Compared to controls specific phobia was associated with all three clinical groups and childhood depression social phobia and PTSD were uniquely associated with adult GAD Both maternal and paternal attachment also differentiated clinical groups from controls However higher levels of subscales reflecting maternal insecure avoidant attachment eg no memory of early childhood experiences and balancingforgiving current state of mind emerged as more predictive of GAD relative to PD There were no group differences in parental loss or separationConclusionsThese results support differentiation of GAD and PD based on

anxiety disorder,The diagnosis of anxiety disorders like other psychiatric disorders also is operationalised since the introduction of diagnostic manuals The diagnostic criteria of Generalised Anxiety Disorder GAD have been tightened in the last decades This leads to the exclusion of patients with a high level of anxiety but not fulfilling certain of the GADcriteria from effective treatment Such socalled subsyndromal subthreshold or subclinical GADstates however often exhibit a comparable burden of disease like the full syndromal disorder and often tend to develop into the full syndromal disorder The purpose of this review is beside systematically reporting the papers found in respective
anxiety disorder,Patients with generalized anxiety disorder experience worry or anxiety and a number of physical and psychologic symptoms The disorder is frequently difficult to diagnose because of the variety of presentations and the common occurrence of comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions The lifetime prevalence is approximately to percent in the general population and is more common in women than in men It is often chronic and patients with this disorder are more likely to be seen by family physicians than by psychiatrists Treatment consists of pharmacotherapy and various forms of psychotherapy The benzodiazepines are used for shortterm treatment but because of

anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder SAD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with key behavioral traits of social fearfulness social avoidance and submissiveness Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety and so may be important in SAD Hormonal alterations often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors eg genetic predisposition x early trauma predispose to socially fearful avoidant and submissive behavior However whereas gene variants and histories of trauma persist hormonal systems can be remodeled over the course of life Hormones play a key role during the periods of

anxiety disorder,BackgroundThis study compares disability levels between different anxiety disorders and healthy controls We further investigate the role of anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviour in disability and whether differences in these symptom patterns contribute to disability differences between anxiety disordersMethodsData were from subjects from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety NESDA The Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument was used to diagnose anxiety disorders The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II was used to measure disability in six domains cognition mobility selfcare social interaction life activities participation Severity of anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviour symptoms was measured using the Beck Anxiety
anxiety disorder,Inventory and the Fear QuestionnaireResultsAll anxiety disorders were associated with higher disability Disability was generally highest in multiple anxiety disorder eg mean disability in cognition and social anxiety disorder mean followed by generalized anxiety disorder mean and panic disorder with agoraphobia mean and lowest in panic disorder without agoraphobia mean Anxiety arousal was more associated with disability in life activities B p and participation B p whereas avoidance behaviour was more associated with disability in cognition B p and social interaction B p Different disability patterns between anxiety disorders were not completely explained by anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviourLimitationsThe crosssectional
anxiety disorder,On the basis of epidemiological survey findings anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders around the world and are associated with significant comorbidity and morbidity Such surveys rely on advances in psychiatric nosology and may also contribute usefully to revisions of the nosology There are a number of questions at the intersection of psychiatric epidemiology and nosology This review addresses the following What is the prevalence of anxiety disorders and how do we best explain crossnational differences in prevalence estimates What are the optimal diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders and how can epidemiological data shed light on this question
anxiety disorder,What are the comorbidities of anxiety disorders and how do we best understand the high comorbidities seen in these conditions What is the current treatment gap for anxiety disorders and what are the implications of current understandings of psychiatric epidemiology and nosology for policymaking relevant to anxiety disorders Here we emphasize that anxiety disorders are the most prevalent of the psychiatric conditions and that rather than merely contrasting crossnational prevalence in anxiety disorders it is more productive to delineate crossnational themes that emerge about the epidemiology of these conditions We discuss that optimizing diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders is an
anxiety disorder,Purpose of reviewHistorically anxiety disorders have not been considered as important determinants of suicide but in the last years many works have challenged this assumption Here we will review the available evidence on the relationship between suicide and anxiety disorders eg obsessivecompulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder and body dysmorphic disorder with special emphasis on findings published in the last yearsRecent findingsOverall anxiety disorders increase the risk of suicide Specifically of patients with social anxiety disorder reported suicidal ideation in the previous month and of them had a history of suicide attempts Similarly in patients with
anxiety disorder,panic disorder suicidal ideation prevalence ranged between and and of them had a history of suicide attempts Generalized anxiety disorder GAD was the most frequent anxiety disorder in completed suicides present in of people who committed suicide and also subthreshold GAD was clearly linked to suicide ideation Posttraumatic stress disorder was positively associated with suicidal ideation and in patients with obsessivecompulsive disorder suicide ideation rates ranged from to and suicide attempts from to Body dysmorphic disorders presented a suicide ideation prevalence of about Suicide risk is increased in subjects with anxiety disorder This risk is higher in the presence of

anxiety disorder,Prevalence of anxiety disorders is high in the elderly between and of the subjects with by order of frequency phobic disorders and generalized anxiety disorder rank ahead of panic disorders obsessivecompulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder Anxiety disorders very often start in adulthood and become chronic thereafter It should be pointed out that each anxiety disorder has clinical characteristics that are modified with aging Among the psychiatric comorbidity depressive disorders and addictions mainly to alcohol especially stand out Very few studies on anxiety disorders were specifically performed in the elderly Drug treatments are mainly based on antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake
anxiety disorder,A recent study has suggested a link between early separation anxiety and personality disorder It is possible that this relationship is mediated or confounded by the presence of adult separation anxiety disorder ASAD In a clinic study of anxiety patients we found that ASAD patients with heightened early separation anxiety had higher rates of any Cluster C personality disorder compared to ASAD patients without elevated early separation anxiety and higher rates of any Cluster B or C personality disorder compared to anxiety patients with low early separation anxiety and no ASAD Although crosssectional in design the study supports a direct
anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorder AD often is under diagnosed and under treated in older adults especially when the clinical presentation of anxiety Symptoms often overlap with medical conditions Of all the anxiety disorders in later life generalized anxiety disorder GAD is one of the most frequently diagnosed AD is often comorbid with depression AD is associated with excess disability Anxiety in older adults has traditionally been treated pharmacology often with benzodiazepine However the clinical recommendations for pharmacologic treatment actually have been much broader including suggestions to consider serotonergic antidepressants Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs and serotonin nor epinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs generally

anxiety disorder,BackgroundPeople with anxiety disorders represent a significant part of a general practitioners patient population However there are organisational obstacles for optimal treatment such as a lack of coordination of illness management and limited access to evidencebased treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy A limited number of studies suggest that collaborative care has a positive effect on symptoms for people with anxiety disorders However most studies are carried out in the USA and none have reported results for social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder separately Thus there is a need for studies carried out in different settings for specific anxiety populations
anxiety disorder,A Danish model for collaborative care the Collabri model has been developed for people diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders The model is evaluated through four trials of which three will be outlined in this protocol and focus on panic disorder generalised anxiety disorder and social phobia The aim is to investigate whether treatment according to the Collabri model has a better effect than usual treatment on symptoms when provided to people with anxiety disordersMethodsThree clusterrandomised clinical superiority trials are set up to investigate treatment according to the Collabri model for collaborative care compared to treatmentasusual for patients diagnosed with

anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorders are frequently associated with affective disorders and represent one of the most important comorbidity in patients with bipolar disorder Their prevalence is high whatever the anxiety disorder with nevertheless higher rates for generalized anxiety disorder to for lifetime prevalence Such high frequencies raise essential questions about the link between these groups of disorders and if it is necessary to distinguish them or to consider their phenomenological overlap as resulting of common disease processes The existence of comorbid anxiety disorder in bipolar disorder significantly worsens its evolution inducing more severe episodes shortening remission periods favoring relapses and suicide as
anxiety disorder,well as substance use and reducing quality of life in comparison to bipolar patients without anxiety The mechanisms that link the anxious symptomatology to mood dysregulation are still poorly understood although it is likely that genetic factors play a key role combined with other factors of vulnerability including those involved in coping strategy to address ongoing distress Despite the high impact of anxiety on the severity of bipolar disorder course few randomized controlled trials examined treatments of comorbid anxiety disorders and only recent recommendations offer useful therapeutic perspectives In this context it seems necessary to better understand the features associated
anxiety disorder,Epileptic patients present with psychiatric disorders more frequently than the general population and patients with other chronic medical conditions Psychiatric disorders can cooccur with epilepsy and can be caused by epilepsy Personality changes as well as psychosis and mood or anxiety disorders can occur in association with epilepsy Anxiety disorders due to epilepsy can manifest as generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder phobias or obsessivecompulsive disorder The risk of an anxiety disorder is higher in patients with focal epilepsy especially those with temporal lobe epilepsy but an anxiety disorder can also occur in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy or generalized tonicclonic
anxiety disorder,epilepsy Herein we present a yearold female patient with comorbid anxiety disorder and epilepsy that improved following initiation of antiepileptic medication The patients EEG showed abnormalities particularly in the frontal lobe Epileptic activationassociated anxiety disorder presented as phobia of swallowing and the patient exhibited features of generalized anxiety disorder Following initiation of antiepileptic medication the seizures stopped and the symptoms of anxiety disappeared in two weeks The patient was receiving psychotherapy once every weeks The patient remained asymptomatic during years of followup This case highlights the importance of differential diagnosis of underlying epilepsy in patients with acute severe anxiety and
anxiety disorder,The frequency of generalized anxiety disorder was higher among firstdegree relatives of probands with generalized anxiety N than among the relatives of control subjects N but it was not higher among relatives of probands with panic disorder N or agoraphobia N Also the frequency of panic disorder was higher among relatives of probands with panic disorder than among control relatives but was not higher among relatives of generalized anxiety probands Relatives of probands with generalized anxiety who had the same disorder had a mild stressrelated illness The results confirm the separation between generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder but challenge
anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorder commonly coexists with personality disorder and emotional disorder which makes it difficult to prioritize thetreatment process However in psychoanalysis we have developed our institution starting from studying anxiety towards human understanding This approach enables us to account anxiety as one of the symptoms which enables us to avoid the difficulty In our country the health insurance system does not allow psychoanalysis treatment beyond sessions of minutes therapy per week This indicates that there is a need to amend the health insurance system I will present a study of psychoanalysis treatment within the current insurance standards one minutes session
anxiety disorder,BackgroundAnxiety scales may help primary care physicians to detect specific anxiety disorders among the many emotionally distressed patients presenting in primary care The anxiety scale of the FourDimensional Symptom Questionnaire 4DSQ consists of an admixture of symptoms of specific anxiety disorders The research questions were Is the anxiety scale unidimensional or multidimensional To what extent does the anxiety scale detect specific DSMIV anxiety disorders Which cutoff points are suitable to rule out or to rule in which anxiety disordersMethodsWe analyzed primary care datasets with standardized psychiatric diagnoses and 4DSQ scores Unidimensionality was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis CFA We examined
anxiety disorder,mean scores and anxiety score distributions per disorder Receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis was used to determine optimal cutoff pointsResultsTotal n was CFA supported unidimensionality The anxiety scale performed slightly better in detecting patients with panic disorder agoraphobia social phobia obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and post traumatic stress disorder PTSD than patients with generalized anxiety disorder GAD and specific phobia ROCanalysis suggested that was the optimal cutoff point to rule out and the cutoff point to rule in anxiety disordersConclusionsThe 4DSQ anxiety scale measures a common trait of pathological anxiety that is characteristic of anxiety disorders in particular panic disorder

anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is a prevalent and highly disabling mental health condition however there is still much to learn with regard to pertinent biomarkers as well as diagnosis made more difficult by the marked and common overlap of GAD with affective and anxiety disorders Recently intensive research efforts have focused on GAD applying neuroimaging genetic and bloodbased approaches toward discovery of pathogenetic and treatmentrelated biomarkers In this paper we review the large amount of available data and we focus in particular on evidence from neuroimaging genetic and neurochemical measurements in GAD in order to better understand potential biomarkers involved
anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD and panic disorder PD are among the most common mental disorders in the United States and they can negatively impact a patients quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy The GAD and the Severity Measure for
anxiety disorder,Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors andor psychotherapy both of which are highly effective Among psychotherapeutic treatments cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has an extensive evidence base Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety symptoms but their use is limited by risk of abuse and adverse effect profiles Physical activity can reduce symptoms of GAD and PD A number of complementary and alternative treatments are often used however evidence is limited for most Several
anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD and panic disorder PD are common mental health conditions in adults that are often seen in primary care Although there is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for PD and GAD evaluation should be considered in patients who express recurrent pervasive worry or present with somatic symptoms not attributed to underlying medical conditions The GAD and Patient Health Questionnaire for PD are validated screening tools that can aid in diagnosis and assessment Anxiety disorders often present with substance use disorders which should be treated concurrently Effective therapies for PD and GAD include cognitive behavior therapy and
anxiety disorder,Generalised anxiety disorder is a persistent and common disorder in which the patient has unfocused worry and anxiety that is not connected to recent stressful events although it can be aggravated by certain situations This disorder is twice as common in women than it is in men Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by feelings of threat restlessness irritability sleep disturbance and tension and symptoms such as palpitations dry mouth and sweating These symptoms are recognised as part of the anxiety syndrome rather than independent complaints The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other common mental disorders and we could regard
anxiety disorder,Our understanding of social anxiety disorder also known as social phobia has moved from rudimentary awareness that it is not merely shyness to a much more sophisticated appreciation of its prevalence its chronic and pernicious nature and its neurobiological underpinnings Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder it has an early age of onsetby age years in about and by age years in about of individualsand it is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness and substance abuse Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder and genetic studies
anxiety disorder,Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD from an official recognition as a residual category in DSMIII has come a long way to be appreciated as a common underlying anxiety pathway in the literature Despite still being defined as extreme anxiety and worry upon performance and about ones health GAD seems to be a general umbrella of anxiety covering even social anxiety and panic disorder PD and even when not treated and chronic leading to major depressive disorder MDD Along the line of some other similar studies and contentions in the present study we sought to validate the hypothesis of GAD encompassing social
anxiety disorder,anxiety as well as performance anxiety and its extension to PD and MDD We also examined the onset of each diagnostic category of GAD PD and MDD and their developmental course in our clinical sample patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD out of referrals to our mood and anxiety clinic during the three months of MayJuly 2019 were identified and included in this research We expanded the definition of GAD as per our clinical observation to include any situations triggering the anxiety including any performance and social situations and did not exclude if the anxiety led to panic attacks The
anxiety disorder,results of our study showed that an encompassing GAD including performance and social anxiety has an early onset recognized partially in childhood but mostly during adolescence An untreated GAD was complicated with panic disorder and episodes of major depression each with an onset later in life GAD in our study was also found to be familial and genetic while its postmorbid depression seemed to be more a reaction to a longstanding untreated anxiety The findings of our study if replicated has research implication of better understanding the developmental course of mood disorders and hold the promise of more targeted treatments
anxiety disorder,In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM separation anxiety disorder has been included in the chapter on anxiety disorders thereby removing the age of onset restriction that previously required first onset during childhood or adolescence Separation anxiety disorder has a lifetime prevalence of and onset often occurs after the age of years Despite the high prevalence separation anxiety disorder is often underdiagnosed and subsequently remains untreated This narrative review summarizes the etiology clinical features diagnostic criteria as well as important differential diagnostic aspects common comorbidity profiles and treatment implications of separation anxiety disorder

anxiety disorder,ObjectivesDue to the cooccurrence of symptoms of anxiety disorders and obsessivecompulsive disorders and the hypothesis about common etiopathological factors we performed a research addressing the occurrence and severity of anxiety symptoms the severity of groups of neurotic symptoms and conducted factor analyses in two groups of patients diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and with generalized anxiety disorder GADMaterial and methodsA retrospective study was conducted on two groups of patients diagnosed with OCD and diagnosed with GAD The source of information about the presence and severity of symptoms was the Symptom Checklist O KOO The impact of sex and the
anxiety disorder,presence or absence of cognitive impairments Benders and Bentons tests on the investigated associations were accounted forResultsNo significant differences in the severity of most anxiety symptoms were found between the groups of patients diagnosed with OCD or GAD Patients with GAD were characterized by a significantly higher intensity of phobic disorders conversion disorders cardiac autonomic dysfunctions and hypochondria when compared to patients with OCD Factor analyses identified the existence of three similar factors in the OCD and the GAD groups anxietydepressiveness obsessions and compulsions Additional factors were among others depressiveness in OCD and separation anxiety in GADConclusionsThe research indicates that

anxiety disorder,BackgroundThere is a lack of clarity regarding specific risk factors discriminating generalized anxiety disorder GAD from panic disorder PDGoalThis study investigated whether GAD and PD could be discriminated through differences in developmental etiological factors including childhood parental lossseparation psychological disorders and maternal and paternal attachmentMethodTwenty people with adult generalized anxiety disorder GAD with adult panic disorder PD with adult comorbid GAD and PD and adult nonanxious controls completed diagnostic interviews to assess symptoms of mental disorders in adulthood and childhood Participants also reported on parental attachment loss and separationResultsChildhood diagnoses of GAD and PD differentiated clinical groups from controls as
anxiety disorder,well as from each other suggesting greater likelihood for homotypic over heterotypic continuity Compared to controls specific phobia was associated with all three clinical groups and childhood depression social phobia and PTSD were uniquely associated with adult GAD Both maternal and paternal attachment also differentiated clinical groups from controls However higher levels of subscales reflecting maternal insecure avoidant attachment eg no memory of early childhood experiences and balancingforgiving current state of mind emerged as more predictive of GAD relative to PD There were no group differences in parental loss or separationConclusionsThese results support differentiation of GAD and PD based on

anxiety disorder,The diagnosis of anxiety disorders like other psychiatric disorders also is operationalised since the introduction of diagnostic manuals The diagnostic criteria of Generalised Anxiety Disorder GAD have been tightened in the last decades This leads to the exclusion of patients with a high level of anxiety but not fulfilling certain of the GADcriteria from effective treatment Such socalled subsyndromal subthreshold or subclinical GADstates however often exhibit a comparable burden of disease like the full syndromal disorder and often tend to develop into the full syndromal disorder The purpose of this review is beside systematically reporting the papers found in respective

anxiety disorder,ObjectivesDue to the cooccurrence of symptoms of anxiety disorders and obsessivecompulsive disorders and the hypothesis about common etiopathological factors we performed a research addressing the occurrence and severity of anxiety symptoms the severity of groups of neurotic symptoms and conducted factor analyses in two groups of patients diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and with generalized anxiety disorder GADMaterial and methodsA retrospective study was conducted on two groups of patients diagnosed with OCD and diagnosed with GAD The source of information about the presence and severity of symptoms was the Symptom Checklist O KOO The impact of sex and the
anxiety disorder,presence or absence of cognitive impairments Benders and Bentons tests on the investigated associations were accounted forResultsNo significant differences in the severity of most anxiety symptoms were found between the groups of patients diagnosed with OCD or GAD Patients with GAD were characterized by a significantly higher intensity of phobic disorders conversion disorders cardiac autonomic dysfunctions and hypochondria when compared to patients with OCD Factor analyses identified the existence of three similar factors in the OCD and the GAD groups anxietydepressiveness obsessions and compulsions Additional factors were among others depressiveness in OCD and separation anxiety in GADConclusionsThe research indicates that

anxiety disorder,BackgroundThere is a lack of clarity regarding specific risk factors discriminating generalized anxiety disorder GAD from panic disorder PDGoalThis study investigated whether GAD and PD could be discriminated through differences in developmental etiological factors including childhood parental lossseparation psychological disorders and maternal and paternal attachmentMethodTwenty people with adult generalized anxiety disorder GAD with adult panic disorder PD with adult comorbid GAD and PD and adult nonanxious controls completed diagnostic interviews to assess symptoms of mental disorders in adulthood and childhood Participants also reported on parental attachment loss and separationResultsChildhood diagnoses of GAD and PD differentiated clinical groups from controls as
anxiety disorder,well as from each other suggesting greater likelihood for homotypic over heterotypic continuity Compared to controls specific phobia was associated with all three clinical groups and childhood depression social phobia and PTSD were uniquely associated with adult GAD Both maternal and paternal attachment also differentiated clinical groups from controls However higher levels of subscales reflecting maternal insecure avoidant attachment eg no memory of early childhood experiences and balancingforgiving current state of mind emerged as more predictive of GAD relative to PD There were no group differences in parental loss or separationConclusionsThese results support differentiation of GAD and PD based on

post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how
post-traumatic stress disorder,PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of
post-traumatic stress disorder,the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding

post-traumatic stress disorder,Since its debut in the psychiatric nomenclature in 1980 posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD has had a dramatic impact on criminal and civil jurisprudence PTSD has created a cottage industry among both criminal and negligence attorneys and mental health practitioners The diagnosis first achieved public notoriety when it was introduced as a new basis for the insanity defense More recently syndrome evidence of the subtypes and variations of PTSD have encroached on the substantive criminal law of selfdefense In addition the diagnosis may have an impact on such traditionally legal and factual determinations as the credibility of witnesses and may undermine
post-traumatic stress disorder,Pain and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD are highly comorbid conditions Patients with chronic pain have higher rates of PTSD Likewise patients with PTSD are often diagnosed with numerous chronic pain conditions Despite the high painPTSD comorbidity the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood and only recently researchers have started investigating it using experimental models In this article we systematically review the substantial clinical evidence on the cooccurrence of pain and PTSD and the limited experimental evidence of pain processing in this disorder We provide a detailed overview of the psychophysical and brain imaging experiments that compared somatosensory

post-traumatic stress disorder,When a spontaneous abortion is followed by complicated bereavement the primary care physician may not consider the diagnosis of acute stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder The major difference between these two conditions is that in acute stress disorder symptoms such as dissociation reliving the trauma avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and increased arousal are present for at least two days but not longer than four weeks When the symptoms persist beyond four weeks the patient may have posttraumatic stress disorder The symptoms of distress response after spontaneous abortion include psychologic physical cognitive and behavioral effects however patients with

post-traumatic stress disorder,It is becoming clear that posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is not simply a psychiatric disorder but one that involves pervasive physiological impairments as well These physiological disturbances deserve attention in any attempt at integrative treatment of PTSD that requires a focus beyond the PTSD symptoms themselves The physiological disturbances in PTSD range over many systems but a common thread thought to underlie them is that the chronic effects of PTSD involve problems with allostatic control mechanisms that result in an excess in what has been termed allostatic load AL A pharmacological approach to reducing AL would be valuable but because

post-traumatic stress disorder,The symptoms of flashbacks nightmares and hypervigilance may be understood by those who have shared or understand a traumatic event but the duration of such symptoms may well outstretch all expectations Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is serious and may affect the rest of a sufferers life Traumatic situations are ubiquitous in the modernday world and can occur in both military and civilian settings A great deal of research into the development and management of PTSD has been carried out in the past two decades although many drug treatments and psychotherapeutic approaches have been investigated no single method has been found
post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is unique amongst psychiatric disorders in two ways Firstly there is usually a very clear point of onset the traumatic event The second unique feature of PTSD is that it is characterized by a failure of the normal response to resolve Given these two characteristics PTSD appears a good candidate for secondary prevention ie interventions immediately after the trauma Evidence available starting from current concepts and contemporary research of potential secondary prevention interventions are presented Common practices in the aftermath of trauma such as debriefing and benzodiazepines need to be carefully considered taking into account their

post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis
post-traumatic stress disorder,factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine findings that suggest possible mechanisms of inflammation in this disorder in terms of two different but interrelated perspectives putative causes of increased proinflammatory activities and potential consequences that inflammation generates Given that there is currently a dearth of treatment options for PTSD possibilities of new therapeutic approaches using pharmacological and

post-traumatic stress disorder,The symptomatology of patients suffering in the aftermath of severe and prolonged traumatization is not entirely covered by the diagnostic criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Consequently the concept of complex PTSD was proposed including symptoms of affective dysregulation dissociation and somatization alterations in selfperception altered relationships with others and altered systems of meaning Thereby a variety of symptoms usually classified as comorbid disorders are combined in a single etiological model The whole symptomatology is considered as more or less effective adaptation strategies and not primarily as deficits This understanding of the underlying etiology in subjects with complex traumatization opens

post-traumatic stress disorder,The symptomatology of patients suffering in the aftermath of severe and prolonged traumatization is not entirely covered by the diagnostic criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Consequently the concept of complex PTSD was proposed including symptoms of affective dysregulation dissociation and somatization alterations in selfperception altered relationships with others and altered systems of meaning Thereby a variety of symptoms usually classified as comorbid disorders are combined in a single etiological model The whole symptomatology is considered as more or less effective adaptation strategies and not primarily as deficits This understanding of the underlying etiology in subjects with complex traumatization opens
post-traumatic stress disorder,In psychiatric literature dissociative reactions at the time of a traumatic event ie peritraumatic dissociation are considered to be risk factors for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD In this article we critically review research concerned with the link between peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD Our main point is that studies in this area heavily rely on retrospective reports of dissociative reactions during the trauma We argue that this methodology has important limitations since people in general and PTSD patients in particular find it difficult to give accurate descriptions of past emotional states Restrictive factors that play a role in

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a condition where one or more very traumatic events that include lifethreatening or extreme psychological stress have left permanent traces of distress that induce sustained suffering In this clinical overview we present current updates in diagnostic criteria and a new diagnosis of complex PTSD and discuss the problems caused by the new PTSD diagnosis criteria partially differing in the DSM and ICD diagnostic manuals Diagnostic challenges caused by symptom variations is discussed as well as the high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric and somatic illnesses Combined forms of treatment
post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how
post-traumatic stress disorder,PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of
post-traumatic stress disorder,the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding

post-traumatic stress disorder,BackgroundThe update of the PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 emphasizes the definition of psychological traumatism as an objective and external event Nevertheless the scientific debate about the criteriology of PTSD its clinical pertinence for application and the role of subjective dimension appears still open Although the relation between psychotrauma and psychosis has been well examined in the way of trauma as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia the potential traumatism represented by the psychotic experience seems to be less knownObjectiveThis paper aims to provide a
post-traumatic stress disorder,state of the art about the PTSD in reaction to psychosis defined as PTSD post psychosis PTSDPP particularly in epidemiological and psychopathological termsMethodsWe performed a bibliographic research on Pubmed using the keywords posttraumatic stress disorder psychological trauma schizophrenia review psychosis first episode psychosis recovery schizophrenia with a first screening on titles and abstracts An acute psychotic episode referred to a decompensation of any pathology of the DSM5schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders or to a mood disorder with psychotic features The articles exclusively interested in the traumatic impact of hospitalizations and treatment conditions were excludedResultsThe literature noted that PTSDPP affected
post-traumatic stress disorder,about a quarter to a third of the psychotic patients interrogated during the recovery of an acute psychotic episode The analytic epidemiology showed that the main validated risk factors for PTSD were also relevant in the development of PTSDPP including past traumatic history childhood trauma and feeling of helplessness during the traumatic event Criticizing the methodological heterogeneity through studies the observational approach brought out the lack of clinical pertinence of the DSM5A criteria defining the traumatic event for PTSD This criteriology failed to consider the subjective dimension of the threat to psychological integrity generated by a psychotrauma Historical case studies
post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled
post-traumatic stress disorder,leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a nonconsensual clinical entity from a likely epistemological slip of the definition of psychotrauma the consideration of potential PTSDPP presents an undoubted clinical relevance Indeed it could help practioners to precise the semiological analysis of patients recovering from an acute psychotic episode to impact the prognosis of psychosis thinking about impairment

schizophrenia,There has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics of schizophrenia over the past years This has revealed a highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect but with additional contributions from rare copy number and coding variants Many specific genes and loci have been implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic research can proceed These point to disturbances in neuronal and particularly synaptic functions that are not confined to a small number of brain regions and circuits Genetic findings have also revealed the nature of schizophrenias close

schizophrenia,Schizophrenia SCZ is a complex mental disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including positive and negative symptoms as well as cognitive impairments Despite the extensive research the underlying neurobiology of SCZ remain elusive To overcome this challenge the use of diverse laboratory modeling techniques encompassing cellular and animal models and innovative approaches like induced pluripotent stem cell iPSCderived neuronal cultures or brain organoids and genetically engineered animal models has been crucial Immortalized cellular models provide controlled environments for investigating the molecular and neurochemical pathways involved in neuronal function while iPSCs and brain organoids derived from patientspecific sources offer significant
schizophrenia,advantage in translational research by facilitating direct comparisons of cellular phenotypes between patientderived neurons and healthycontrol neurons Animal models can recapitulate the different psychopathological aspects that should be modeled offering valuable insights into the neurobiology of SCZ In addition invertebrates models are genetically tractable and offer a powerful approach to dissect the core genetic underpinnings of SCZ while vertebrate models especially mammals with their more complex nervous systems and behavioral repertoire provide a closer approximation of the human condition to study SCZrelated traits This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse modeling approaches critically evaluating their strengths and

schizophrenia,While in the midth the 19th century Griesinger and years later MayerGross regarded schizophrenia as a brain disease a farreaching change in the view of schizophrenia found expression in the review of Manfred Bleuler in 1951 All classical assumptions of the schizophrenia doctrine and especially that schizophrenia could be classified a somatically conditioned illness and not psychogenic would be as he wrote shaken severely On the 1st International Meeting of Neuropathology in Rome 1952 the opinion became generally accepted that pathological changes of the brain could not be expected in schizophrenias The neuropathological research into psychoses considered as unfruitful has
schizophrenia,been practically stopped The World Congress of Zrich The group of schizophrenias has summarized through Walter Schulte that schizophrenia must be understood as a riddle of the human being unapproachable for the methods of scientific medicine In contrary to the main trends of psychiatry of that time we were convinced that schizophrenias have a pathologicalsomatic basis and considered the search for empirical indications of the somatosis hypothesis an aim of research having priority Thus we tried to associate findings gained with the available somatic methods neurohistopathology neuroradiology neurophysiology neuropsychology neurochemistry with clinical syndromes and course of the disorder These investigations
schizophrenia,directed to psychopathologicalsomatic correlations went already since the monograph of 1957 hand in hand with the gradual development of the basic symptom concept BSC and of the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic symptoms BSABS and with our longterm course and early recognition research I originated with three observations made at the Heidelberg Clinic of Kurt Schneider the cenesthetic schizophrenia the asthenic pure defect and lethal catatonias patients who were diagnosed clinically as idiopathic schizophrenias but could be separated from idiopathic schizophrenias as symptomatic by neurohistopathological findings of post mortem examinations and eg diagnosed as sporadic atypical encephalitis The
schizophrenia,cenesthetic type had a pilot function for the development of the BSC because in its course the basic symptomatology determined as well the prodromes before the first psychotic episode as after that the reversible postpsychotic basic stages respectively the irreversible pure defect syndromes into which two thirds of cenesthetic schizophrenias terminate then because with this type the first time has been observed that from initially quite uncharacteristic basic symptoms BS level BS qualitatively peculiar basic symptoms level BS and then distinct psychotic symptoms ie bodily hallucinations arise and because in patients with persisting pure deficiency syndromes neuromorphological changes in the
schizophrenia,sense of a basal ganglia syndrome could be proved The clinical neuroradiological correlation study in schizophrenic patients with slight residues or full remissions and chronic schizophrenias as well as in patients with organic psychosyndromes of different diagnostic groups reveal that brain imaging and biologicalpsychiatric research are only promising in close connection with clinical psychopathology and observation of the course if they aim to assign certain structural or functional cerebral disturbances with certain clinical symptoms and syndromes In this respect schizophrenic schizoaffective and affective idiopathic psychosyndromes do not differ from somatically based psychoses in definable brain diseases With functionaldynamic parameters the
schizophrenia,differentiation in process active and inactive stages has to be made guided by the actual clinical psychopathological syndrome at the moment of the collecting of the electroencephalographic neurochemical fMRI or PET findings The reasons of inconsistencies of the EEG PEG CT MRI PET findings are analysed and it is shown that they are frequently conditioned by insufficient definition of the random sample and with functionaldynamic parameters by the missing consideration of the process activity The Bonn Schizophrenia Longterm Study and the BonnCologne early recognition study established that the dichotomic models of course of schizophrenia cannot be maintained Negative respectively minus
schizophrenia,symptoms in the sense of basic symptoms precede the positive ones many years negative schizophrenias pass over into positive ones and vice versa In the search for morphological brain findings an irreversible psychopathological alteration with the component of a pure dynamiccognitive deficiency syndrome is relevant as clinical criterion while other persisting psychosyndromes as structural deformities and pure psychosis usually show no morphological brain changes Schizophrenia is not always associated with neuromorphological changes There exists a group of neuroradiologically negative schizophrenias with small dysplastic ventricles and other constitutional anomalies that is characterized by a premorbid psychopathic personality and a typically schizophrenic
schizophrenia,personality deformation Brain alterations regarding the 3rd and the lateral ventricles in the neighbourhood of the basal ganglia can be found in the subgroup with irreversible dynamiccognitive pure defect but not in courses with full psychopathological remission According to Dewan for the first time a correlation between psychopathological and brain morphological findings in schizophrenics with the component of pure residual syndrome has been found by our studies as well as a parallel progression of the cerebral atrophy and the psychopathological changes Quantitativemorphometric and MRI changes of regions of the limbic system and neurophysiological findings are hints that disorders in limbic

schizophrenia,Remitting schizophrenia is an important phenomenon in the United States largely because of the broad concept of schizophrenia used here Clinical and family investigations of this condition suggest a close link between remitting schizophrenia and the affective disorders However the elevated morbidity risk of schizophrenia in firstdegree relatives of remitting schizophrenics precludes the conclusion that remitting schizophrenia is simply a variant of affective disorders The following testable hypothesis is consistent with the available data remitting schizophrenia is a heterogeneous mixture of mania unipolar depression and typical schizophrenia Mania and unipolar depression account for the majority of such disorders although schizophrenia
schizophrenia,Two psychophysiological measures poor suppression of midlatency auditoryevoked responses in a paired stimulus paradigm and ocular motor abnormalities may index genetic liability for schizophrenia An important feature of these measures is that both patients and their nonpsychotic relatives exhibit basically the same performance These measures may be successful endophenotypes for schizophrenia because they assess poor response inhibition associated with dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuitry Data bearing on this hypothesis are reviewed and it is posited that assessment of the auditoryevoked gamma band response and saccade measures of inhibitory abilities are the most valid behavioral measures of schizophrenias neuropathological correlates

schizophrenia,This paper aims to discuss and test the hypothesis raised by FusarPoli FusarPoli P Can neuroimaging prove that schizophrenia is a brain disease A radical hypothesis Medical Hypotheses in press corrected proof that on the basis of the available imaging literature there is no consistent evidence to reject the radical and provocative hypothesis that schizophrenia is not a brain disease To achieve this goal all metaanalyses on fMRI and schizophrenia published during the current decade and indexed in Pubmed were summarized as much as some other useful information eg metaanalyses on genetic risk factors Our main conclusion is that the
schizophrenia,literature fully supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a syndrome not a disease associated with brain abnormalities despite the fact that there is no singular and reductionist pathway from the nosographic entity schizophrenia to its causes This irreducibility is due to the fact that the syndrome has more than one dimension eg cognitive psychotic and negative and each of them is related to abnormalities in specific neuronal networks A psychiatric diagnosis is a statistical procedure these dimensions are not identically represented in each diagnosticated case and this explains the existence of more than one pattern of brain abnormalities related to
schizophrenia,schizophrenia For example chronification is associated with negativism while the first psychotic episode is not in that sense the same person living with schizophrenia may reveal different symptoms and fMRI patterns along the course of his life and this is precisely what defines schizophrenia since the time when it was called Dementia Praecox first by pick then by Kraepelin It is notable that of the collected metaanalyses on fMRI and schizophrenia reveal positive findings Moreover all metaanalyses that found positive associations between schizophrenia and genetic risk factors have to do with genes SNPs especially activated in neuronal tissue of the

schizophrenia,Since 1911 when E Bleuler thought of the socalled latent schizophrenia as the most frequent type of schizophrenia but most seldom diagnosed as such the question whether there exist abortive forms of schizophrenia was discussed again and again so in 1932 by MayerGross who devoted to the uncharacteristic onset of schizophrenia a special chapter in 1938 by Stern socalled borderline neuroses und in 1949 by Hoch and Polatin pseudoneurotic schizophrenias Since the 50s Huber had described by means of followup studies the uncharacteristic basic stages occurring long before the onset and after remission of the florid symptomatology in 1957 the
