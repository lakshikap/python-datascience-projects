Label,Abstract
clinical depression,Although anxiety and depression have been considered as two distinct entities according to the diagnostic criteria anxious depression comorbid anxiety and depression is relatively a common syndrome According to the DSM criteria it uses with anxious distress specifier to define anxious depression in its MDD section Anxious depression is known to have different neurobiological profiles compared to nonanxious depression Several studies have revealed significant differences between anxious depression and nonanxious depression regarding the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal HPA
clinical depression,axis function structural and functional brain imaging findings inflammation markers etc Patients with anxious depression were significantly more likely to be found in primary care setting and more likely to be associated with female gender nonsingle unemployed less educated and more severe depression Previous reports also showed that patients with anxious depression had more frequent episodes of major depression and a higher risk of suicidal ideation and previous suicide attempts than those with nonanxious depression
clinical depression,Major depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating personal and public health conditions worldwide Less appreciated is that depressions tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives whereas half or more will never have a recurrence Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression
clinical depression,ObjectiveAdolescence is a formative and turbulent phase where physiological psychosocial and cognitive changes leave adolescents vulnerable to psychological disorders Given the lack of reviews that consolidate and compare worldwide prevalence of depression among adolescents this review aims to examine the global prevalence of major depressive disorders dysthymia and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescentsMethodsA systematic review and metaanalysis was conducted Six databases were searched for studies published from 2001 to December 2020 Seventytwo studies were included
clinical depression,Subgroup analysis were performed for year of publication geographical region gender and assessment tools usedResultsThe global point prevalence rate of elevated selfreported depressive symptoms from 2001 to 2020 was CI Point prevalence for major depressive disorder MDD and dysthymia was CI and CI respectively The pooled oneyear prevalence and lifetime prevalence for MDD were CI and CI Point prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents increased from CI between 2001 and 2010 to CI between
clinical depression,2011 and 2020 The Middle East Africa and Asia have the highest prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and female adolescents were reported to have a higher prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms than male adolescentsConclusionBesides targeting those with existing clinical depression research and policies should also focus on educational and supportive mitigation efforts to curb depressive symptoms among adolescents before escalation The findings encourage future research to develop more genderspecific and culturally relevant intervention programmesPractitioner points
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The
clinical depression,aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD have been the subject of extensive research and there is a vast body of literature that exists Here we overview the key hypotheses that have been proposed for the neurobiology of MDD and highlight the need for a unified model as many of these pathways are integrated Key pathways discussed
clinical depression,Purpose of reviewWe give an overview of recent developments on psychological treatments of depression in primary careRecent findingsIn recent years it has become clear that psychotherapies can effectively be delivered through ehealth applications Furthermore several studies in low and middle income countries have shown that lay health counselors can effectively deliver psychological therapies Behavioral activation a relatively simple form of therapy has been found to be as effective as cognitive behavior therapy Treatment of subthreshold
clinical depression,BackgroundBurnout and clinical depression have been variably viewed as synonymous or as distinctly differing entities but with few distinguishing features provided Failure to differentiate the two conditions can lead to compromised clinical management We sought to enhance the differentiation of burnout and clinical depression by assembling a list of candidate differentiating featuresMethodsIn assembling a set of distinguishing clinical features we compared burnout states against the two principal depressive subtypes ie melancholic and nonmelancholic depression rather
clinical depression,than against major depression per se Our candidate features were assembled from a review of salient literature our clinical observations and from a subsample of subjects who selfidentified as having experienced both burnout and depression and who volunteered differentiating featuresResultsWe judged that burnout shares few features with melancholic depression While burnout and nonmelancholic depression share a set of symptoms differences were greater than commonalitiesLimitationsOur findings were based on clinical observation and exploratory research rather than
clinical depression,The interaction of physical and mental vulnerability and environmental constraints is thought to foster the development of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD A central factor in the development of psychopathology is mental stress Despite some evidence for parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity in MDD the psychophysiological response to stress in depression is not clearcut Given the growing interest in heart rate and heart rate variability as indicators for remote monitoring of patients
clinical depression,it is important to understand how patients with MDD react to stress in a laboratorycontrolled environment We conducted a systematic review of studies using electrocardiography to derive heart rate and heart rate variability during stress in patients with clinical depression We focused on wellvalidated stress tasks the mental arithmetic stress task the Trier social stress task and public speaking task to minimize confounding effects due to the nature of the stressor The majority of studies
clinical depression,It has been years since repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC was approved by the FDA for clinical depression treatment Yet the underlying mechanisms for rTMSinduced depression relief are not fully elucidated This study analyzes TMSelectroencephalogram EEG data from healthy control HC subjects and patients with major depressive disorder MDD before and after rTMS treatment Prior to treatment patients with MDD have lower activity in the DLPFC the hippocampus HPC
clinical depression,the orbitofrontal cortex OFC and DLPFCOFC connectivity compared with HCs Following active rTMS treatment patients with MDD show a significant increase in the DLPFC HPC and OFC Notably the increase in HPC activity is specifically associated with amelioration of depressive symptoms but not anxiety or sleep quality The orbitofrontalhippocampal pathway plays a crucial role in mediating depression relief following rTMS treatment These findings suggest potential alternative targets for brain stimulation therapy against depression chictrorgcn ChiCTR2100052007
clinical depression,ObjectiveTo consider how a mental health professional might respond to a newly diagnosed depressed patient who inquires into its potential genetic origins and whether they might pass depression on to their childrenMethodsData are provided on risk and pursuit of genetic pathwaysResultsAs most studies have focussed on DSMdefined major depression and which is not an entity no definitive data are available while there are some few studies indicating a greater genetic risk in those with melancholic
clinical depression,In this Seminar we discuss developments from the past years in the diagnosis neurobiology and treatment of major depressive disorder For diagnosis psychiatric and medical comorbidity have been emphasised as important factors in improving the appropriate assessment and management of depression Advances in neurobiology have also increased and we aim to indicate genetic molecular and neuroimaging studies that are relevant for assessment and treatment selection of this disorder Further studies of depressionspecific psychotherapies the continued
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder is frequently accompanied by sleep disturbances such as insomnia or hypersomnia and polysomnographic sleep findings of increased rapideyemovement sleep and decreased slow wave sleep For many patients insomnia persists even after mood symptoms have been adequately treated These patients have poorer outcomes than patients without sleep problems These outcomes suggest that overlapping neural mechanisms regulate sleep and mood Treatment of these patients can incorporate sedating antidepressants nonbenzodiazepine aminobutyric acid agonists and cognitive
clinical depression,Treatmentresistant depression TRD typically refers to inadequate response to at least one antidepressant trial of adequate doses and duration TRD is a relatively common occurrence in clinical practice with up to to of the patients not achieving adequate response following antidepressant treatment A diagnostic reevaluation is essential to the proper management of these patients In particular the potential role of several contributing factors such as medical and psychiatric comorbidity needs to be taken into account
clinical depression,Major Depressive Disorder MDD is common among cancer patients with prevalence rates up to fourtimes higher than the general population Depression confers worse outcomes including nonadherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression Moreover psychosocial stressors in cancer promote inflammation and oxidativenitrosative stress a decreased immunosurveillance and a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous
clinical depression,system and of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis Consequently the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms cognitive dysfunction fatigue and sleep disturbances is a public health priority Moreover behavioral strategies aiming at reducing psychological distress and depressive symptoms including addressing unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices as well as physical inactivity and sleep dysfunction may represent important strategies not only to treat depression but also to improve
clinical depression,Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder MDD with deficits observed across several domains eg executive function memory attention While depression alone is disabling patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments poorer clinical recovery and reduced quality of life Consequently it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD Areas covered This review spans psychological physical and pharmacological treatment approaches for
clinical depression,cognitive dysfunction in depression Where possible the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains eg attention and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement In addition the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments eg exercise and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored Expert opinion Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional andor clinical recovery however the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy
clinical depression,Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression but despite advances in pharmacological therapies many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response even after treatments with several medications As such there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient Areas covered This review examines the recent findings coming from different omic sciences in human bloodbased
clinical depression,biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on geneticepigenetic and biochemical biomarkers Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity and inflammation because of their involvement in the pathophysiology of depression and antidepressant response Expert commentary Biomarker identification is still an ongoing work Indeed to date no biomarkers have sufficiently proven specificity sensitivity and reproducibility to be used in the clinical setting However omic approaches hold great promise in identifying
clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the
clinical depression,core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous
clinical depression,with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad other specified bipolar and related disorders New specifiers of MDD with anxious distress and with mixed features allow characterization of additional symptoms The specifier with perinatal onset expands on the DSMIV postnatal onset to include onset during pregnancy We review the changes in
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients
clinical depression,with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly affected by depression In regard to treatment several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated as treatments for cognitive dysfunction in individuals with MDD However very few studies of treatments for cognitive function in patients with MDD have been adequate in terms of sample size and study methods to guide
clinical depression,Pleasure and motivation are important factors for goaldirected behavior and wellbeing in both animals and humans Intact hedonic capacity requires an undisturbed interplay between a number of different brain regions and transmitter systems Concordantly dysfunction of networks encoding for reward have been shown in depression and other psychiatric disorders The development of technological possibilities to investigate connectivity on a functional level in humans and to directly influence networks in animals using optogenetics among other techniques
clinical depression,has provided new important insights in this field of researchIn this review we aim to provide an overview on the neurobiological substrates of anhedonia on a network level For this purpose definition of anhedonia and the involved reward components are described first then current data on reward networks in healthy individuals and in depressed patients are summarized and the roles of different neurotransmitter systems involved in reward processing are specified Based on this information the
clinical depression,impact of different therapeutic approaches on reward processing is described with a particular focus on deep brain stimulation DBS as a possibility for a direct modulation of human brain structures in vivoOverall results of current studies emphasize the importance of anhedonia in psychiatric disorders and the relevance of targeting this phenotype for a successful psychiatric treatment However more data incorporating these results for the refinement of methodological approaches are needed to be able to develop
clinical depression,Depression clinical interview corpora are essential for advancing automated depression diagnosis While previous studies have used written speech material in controlled settings these materials do not accurately represent spontaneous conversational speech Additionally selfreported measures of depression are subject to bias making the data unreliable for training models for realworld scenarios This study introduces a new corpus of depression clinical interviews collected directly from a psychiatric hospital containing recordings with healthy and depressive patients The subjects
clinical depression,were examined using the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS in Chinese Their final diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by a psychiatry specialist All interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim and annotated by experienced physicians This dataset is a valuable resource for automated depression detection research and is expected to advance the field of psychology Baseline models for detecting and predicting depression presence and level were built and descriptive statistics
clinical depression,Although there is some debate about the relative prevalence rates of depression in African Americans compared to Whites there is little debate among investigators that there is a shortage of research data on depression in African Americans generally and more specifically on African American women Lack of adequate and sufficient research on African Americans contributes to the problems of misdiagnoses underdiagnoses and undertreatment of depression in African Americans generally and more specifically African American women
clinical depression,The clinical phenotype of the socalled lateonset depression LOD affecting up to of older adults and yielding heterogeneous manifestations concerning symptoms severity and course has not been fully elucidated yet This European crosssectional noninterventional naturalistic multicenter study systematically investigated sociodemographic and clinical correlates of earlyonset depression EOD and LOD age of onset years in adult in and outpatients of both sexes receiving adequate psychopharmacotherapy In a total of patients with known age of disease onset
clinical depression,LOD was identified in and was associated with unemployment an ongoing relationship single major depressive episodes lower current suicidal risk and higher occurrence of comorbid hypertension In contrast EOD was related to higher rates of comorbid migraine and additional psychotherapy Although the applied study design does not allow to draw any causal conclusions the present results reflect broad clinical settings and emphasize easily obtainable features which might be characteristic for EOD and LOD A thoughtful
clinical depression,Mental disorders are rapidly increasing each year and have become a major challenge affecting the social and financial wellbeing of individuals There is a need for phenotypic characterization of psychiatric disorders with biomarkers to provide a rich signature for Major Depressive Disorder improving the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these mental disorders This comprehensive review focuses on depression and relapse detection modalities such as selfquestionnaires audiovisuals and EEG highlighting noteworthy publications in the last
clinical depression,ten years The article concentrates on the literature that adopts machine learning by audiovisual and EEG signals It also outlines preprocessing feature extraction and public datasets for depression detection The review concludes with recommendations that will help improve the reliability of developed models and the determinism of computational intelligencebased systems in psychiatry To the best of our knowledge this survey is the first comprehensive review on depression and relapse prediction by selfquestionnaires audiovisual and EEGbased
clinical depression,The past decade has witnessed a resurgence of interest in behavioral interventions for depression This contemporary work is grounded in the work of Lewinsohn and colleagues which laid a foundation for future clinical practice and science This review thus summarizes the origins of a behavioral model of depression and the behavioral activation BA approach to the treatment and prevention of depression We highlight the formative initial work by Lewinsohn and colleagues the evolution of this
clinical depression,BackgroundSymptom severity as a moderator of treatment response has been the subject of debate over the past years Each of the meta and megaanalyses examining the treatment significance of depression severity used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD wholly or in part to define severity though the cutoff used to define severe depression varied There is limited empirical research establishing cutoff scores for bands of severity on the HAMD The goal of the study is
clinical depression,to empirically establish cutoff scores on the HAMD in their allocation of patients to severity groupsMethodsSix hundred twentyseven outpatients with current major depressive disorder were evaluated with a semistructured diagnostic interview Scores on the item HAMD were derived from ratings according to the conversion method described by Endicott et al 1981 The patients were also rated on the Clinical Global Index of Severity CGI Receiver operating curves were computed to identify the cutoff that optimally
clinical depression,discriminated between patients with mild vs moderate and moderate vs severe depressionResultsHAMD scores were significantly lower in patients with mild depression than patients with moderate depression and patients with moderate depression scored significantly lower than patients with severe depression The cutoff score on the HAMD that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity was for the comparison of mild vs moderate depression and for the comparison of moderate vs severe depressionLimitationsThe present study was conducted
clinical depression,in a single outpatient practice in which the majority of patients were white female and had health insurance Although the study was limited to a single site a strength of the recruitment procedure was that the sample was not selected for participation in a treatment study and exclusion and inclusion criteria did not reduce the representativeness of the patient groups The analyses were based on HAMD scores extracted from ratings on the SADS However we
clinical depression,ObjectivebackgroundPatients with obstructive sleep apnea OSA experience daytime sleepiness cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms However the measured prevalence of clinical depression in OSA using standardized clinical assessment is currently unclear The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of clinical depression and antidepressant use in untreated OSA patients to examine predictors of depression and to conduct an exploratory metaanalysis to determine the pooled prevalence of clinical depression in this populationPatientsmethodsIn sum consecutive patients

clinical depression,Purpose of reviewScreening for clinical depression and bipolar disorder remains controversial Screening is usually based on finding discriminating symptoms but not all tools perform equally well Clinicians should be able to assess the clinical utility of screening tests as well as their accuracy and acceptabilityRecent findingsScreening for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ has been extensively examined Four main versions of scoring the PHQ exist The twoitem PHQ2 the nineitem PHQ9 the PHQ DSMIV
clinical depression,algorithm and the twostep PHQ2 then PHQ9 Recent results suggest that the PHQ9 is more accurate than the PHQ2 and that the algorithm scoring method is preferred to the linear cutoff score The twostep procedure has promise but it has not been adequately tested Two screening questions may be a useful compromise in medical settings as they take less than min but about a quarter of patients do not receive screening even when implemented systematically
clinical depression,Alternative customized questionnaires have been developed in medical settings such as the Depression Screening in Parkinsons Disease DESPAR and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy NDDIE Screening for bipolar disorders is an even greater challenge than screening for unipolar depression Screening in primary care and the community has low positive predictive value Screening in highrisk samples such as those with known depression is somewhat more successful but not yet sufficiently accurate to be used aloneSummaryScreening

clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the
clinical depression,core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous
clinical depression,with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad other specified bipolar and related disorders New specifiers of MDD with anxious distress and with mixed features allow characterization of additional symptoms The specifier with perinatal onset expands on the DSMIV postnatal onset to include onset during pregnancy We review the changes in
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients

clinical depression,Major depressive disorder is frequently accompanied by sleep disturbances such as insomnia or hypersomnia and polysomnographic sleep findings of increased rapideyemovement sleep and decreased slow wave sleep For many patients insomnia persists even after mood symptoms have been adequately treated These patients have poorer outcomes than patients without sleep problems These outcomes suggest that overlapping neural mechanisms regulate sleep and mood Treatment of these patients can incorporate sedating antidepressants nonbenzodiazepine aminobutyric acid agonists and cognitive
clinical depression,Treatmentresistant depression TRD typically refers to inadequate response to at least one antidepressant trial of adequate doses and duration TRD is a relatively common occurrence in clinical practice with up to to of the patients not achieving adequate response following antidepressant treatment A diagnostic reevaluation is essential to the proper management of these patients In particular the potential role of several contributing factors such as medical and psychiatric comorbidity needs to be taken into account
clinical depression,Major Depressive Disorder MDD is common among cancer patients with prevalence rates up to fourtimes higher than the general population Depression confers worse outcomes including nonadherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression Moreover psychosocial stressors in cancer promote inflammation and oxidativenitrosative stress a decreased immunosurveillance and a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous
clinical depression,system and of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis Consequently the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms cognitive dysfunction fatigue and sleep disturbances is a public health priority Moreover behavioral strategies aiming at reducing psychological distress and depressive symptoms including addressing unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices as well as physical inactivity and sleep dysfunction may represent important strategies not only to treat depression but also to improve
clinical depression,Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder MDD with deficits observed across several domains eg executive function memory attention While depression alone is disabling patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments poorer clinical recovery and reduced quality of life Consequently it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD Areas covered This review spans psychological physical and pharmacological treatment approaches for
clinical depression,cognitive dysfunction in depression Where possible the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains eg attention and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement In addition the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments eg exercise and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored Expert opinion Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional andor clinical recovery however the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy
clinical depression,Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression but despite advances in pharmacological therapies many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response even after treatments with several medications As such there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient Areas covered This review examines the recent findings coming from different omic sciences in human bloodbased
clinical depression,biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on geneticepigenetic and biochemical biomarkers Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity and inflammation because of their involvement in the pathophysiology of depression and antidepressant response Expert commentary Biomarker identification is still an ongoing work Indeed to date no biomarkers have sufficiently proven specificity sensitivity and reproducibility to be used in the clinical setting However omic approaches hold great promise in identifying
clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the
clinical depression,core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous
clinical depression,with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad other specified bipolar and related disorders New specifiers of MDD with anxious distress and with mixed features allow characterization of additional symptoms The specifier with perinatal onset expands on the DSMIV postnatal onset to include onset during pregnancy We review the changes in
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients
clinical depression,with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly affected by depression In regard to treatment several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated as treatments for cognitive dysfunction in individuals with MDD However very few studies of treatments for cognitive function in patients with MDD have been adequate in terms of sample size and study methods to guide
clinical depression,Pleasure and motivation are important factors for goaldirected behavior and wellbeing in both animals and humans Intact hedonic capacity requires an undisturbed interplay between a number of different brain regions and transmitter systems Concordantly dysfunction of networks encoding for reward have been shown in depression and other psychiatric disorders The development of technological possibilities to investigate connectivity on a functional level in humans and to directly influence networks in animals using optogenetics among other techniques
clinical depression,has provided new important insights in this field of researchIn this review we aim to provide an overview on the neurobiological substrates of anhedonia on a network level For this purpose definition of anhedonia and the involved reward components are described first then current data on reward networks in healthy individuals and in depressed patients are summarized and the roles of different neurotransmitter systems involved in reward processing are specified Based on this information the
clinical depression,impact of different therapeutic approaches on reward processing is described with a particular focus on deep brain stimulation DBS as a possibility for a direct modulation of human brain structures in vivoOverall results of current studies emphasize the importance of anhedonia in psychiatric disorders and the relevance of targeting this phenotype for a successful psychiatric treatment However more data incorporating these results for the refinement of methodological approaches are needed to be able to develop
clinical depression,Depression clinical interview corpora are essential for advancing automated depression diagnosis While previous studies have used written speech material in controlled settings these materials do not accurately represent spontaneous conversational speech Additionally selfreported measures of depression are subject to bias making the data unreliable for training models for realworld scenarios This study introduces a new corpus of depression clinical interviews collected directly from a psychiatric hospital containing recordings with healthy and depressive patients The subjects
clinical depression,were examined using the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS in Chinese Their final diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by a psychiatry specialist All interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim and annotated by experienced physicians This dataset is a valuable resource for automated depression detection research and is expected to advance the field of psychology Baseline models for detecting and predicting depression presence and level were built and descriptive statistics
bipolar disorder,BackgroundEpisode duration recurrence rates and time spent in manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder BD is not well defined for subtypes of the disorderMethodsWe reviewed the course timing and duration of episodes of mania and depression among clinically treated DSMIVTR BD patients of various types and compared duration and rates as well as total proportion of time in depressive versus manic episodes during average years at riskResultsAs expected episodes of depressions were much longer
bipolar disorder,than manias but episodeduration did not differ among BD diagnostic types I II with mainly mixedepisodes BDMx or with psychotic features BDP Recurrence rates episodesyear and proportion of time in depression and their ratios to mania were highest in BDII and BDMx subjects with more maniasyear in psychotic and BDI subjects In most BDsubtypes except with psychotic features there was more time in depressive than manic morbidity owing mainly to longer depressive than manic episodes
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a serious disorder of mood that is associated with considerable psychosocial and economic morbidity Even though it is more common than previously thought it has until relatively recently been somewhat neglected in terms of research when compared to disorders such as schizophrenia and major depression Recent advances in the fields of nosology epidemiology and molecular genetics in particular have begun to unravel some of the complexity of this disorder and the next
bipolar disorder,Over the last decade there has been a growing appreciation of the importance of identifying and treating cognitive impairment associated with bipolar disorder since it persists in remission periods Evidence indicates that neurocognitive dysfunction may significantly influence patients psychosocial outcomes An everincreasing body of research seeks to achieve a better understanding of potential moderators contributing to cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder in order to develop prevention strategies and effective treatments This review provides an overview
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BD is a leading cause of global disability Its biological basis is unknown and its treatment unsatisfactory Here we review two recent areas of progress First the discovery of risk genes and their implications with a focus on voltagegated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target Second facilitated by new technologies it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one
bipolar disorder,Characterized by the switch of manic and depressive phases bipolar disorder was described as early as the fifth century BC Nevertheless up to date the underlying neurobiology is still largely unclear assuming a multifactor genesis with both biologicalgenetic and psychosocial factors Significant process has been achieved in recent years in researching the causes of bipolar disorder with modern molecular biological eg genetic and epigenetic studies and imaging techniques eg positron emission tomography PET and functional
bipolar disorder,AimsThis article examines the ongoing debate concerning the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents This contentious issue has generated robust discussion over the past two decades without consensus and as such the true prevalence of socalled paediatric bipolar disorder PBD remains unknown In this article we offer a solution to break this deadlockMethodsRecent metaanalyses and additional literature concerning the definition and prevalence of PBD was critically reviewed with a view to understanding the
bipolar disorder,perspectives of those developing the taxonomy of PBD and those engaged in research and clinical practiceResultsA key finding is the lack of iteration and meaningful communication between the various groups interested in PBD that stems from deepseated problems within our classificatory systems This undermines our research efforts and complicates clinical practice These problems make the already difficult diagnosis of bipolar disorder in adults even more challenging to transpose to younger populations and additional complexities arise
bipolar disorder,when parsing clinical phenomenology from normative developmental changes in youth Therefore in those manifesting bipolar symptoms postpuberty we argue for the use of adolescent bipolar disorder to describe bipolar symptoms whereas in prepubertal children we propose a reconceptualisation that allows symptomatic treatment to be advanced whilst requiring critical review of these symptoms over timeConclusionSignificant changes in our current taxonomy are necessary and to be clinically meaningful these revisions to our diagnoses need to be developmentallyinformed
bipolar disorder,PurposeThis review article provides an overview of the frequency burden of illness diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder BD from the perspective of the advanced practice nurses APNsData sourcesPubMed searches were conducted using the following keywords bipolar disorder and primary care restricted to dates 2000 to present bipolar disorder and nurse practitioner and bipolar disorder and clinical nurse specialist Selected articles were relevant to adult outpatient care in the United States with a prioritization of
bipolar disorder,articles written by APNs or published in nursing journalsConclusionsBD has a substantial lifetime prevalence in the population at Because the manic or depressive symptoms of BD tend to be severe and recurrent over a patients lifetime the condition is associated with significant burden to the individual caregivers and society Clinician awareness that BD may be present increases the likelihood of successful recognition and appropriate treatment A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are available for
bipolar disorder,People with bipolar disorder frequently experience persistent residual symptoms problems in psychosocial functioning cognitive impairment and poor quality of life In the last decade the treatment target in clinical and research settings has focused not only on clinical remission but also on functional recovery and more lately in personal recovery taking into account patients wellbeing and quality of life Hence the trend in psychiatry and psychology is to treat bipolar disorder in an integrative and
bipolar disorder,holistic manner This literature review offers an overview regarding psychosocial functioning in bipolar disorder First a brief summary is provided regarding the definition of psychosocial functioning and the tools to measure it Then the most reported variables influencing the functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder are listed Thereafter we include a section discussing therapies with proven efficacy at enhancing functional outcomes Other possible therapies that could be useful to prevent functional decline and improve
bipolar disorder,ObjectivesPaediatric bipolar disorder bipolar disorder occurring in prepubertal children is a diagnosis subject to considerable controversy Whilst historically considered to be very rare proponents since the 1990s have argued that mania can present differently in children and as such is much more common than previously thought Such proposals raise questions about the validity of proposed phenotypes and potential risks of iatrogenic harmMethodsI critically examine the construct of paediatric bipolar disorder using Robins and Guzes 1970American

bipolar disorder,Further understanding of older age bipolar disorder OABD may lead to more specific recommendations for treatment adjusted to the specific characteristics and needs caused by agerelated somatic and cognitive changes Lateonset mania has a broad differential diagnosis and requires full psychiatric and somatic workup including brain imaging Research on pharmacotherapy in OABD is limited Firstline treatment of OABD is similar to that for adult bipolar disorder BD with specific attention to vulnerability to side effects
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BPD is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment Over the past decades BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis phenomenology and treatment of paediatric
bipolar disorder,BPD The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity Therefore longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD Given high rates of genetic predisposition for BPD assessment of youth should focus on obtaining accurate family history of this condition Additionally there has been a substantial increase in randomised
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum particularly among unaffected firstdegree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits This suggests a model in which large doses
bipolar disorder,of risk variants cause illness but mild to moderate doses confer advantages which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population Bipolar disorder may thus be better conceptualized as a dimensional trait existing at the extreme of normal population variation in positive temperament personality and cognitive traits aspects of which may reflect a shared vulnerability with creativity Investigations of this shared vulnerability may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying illness and suggest novel treatments
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by depressive manic and mixed episodes The illness affects about of the population Bipolar I disorders affect both genders equally whereas bipolar II disorders seem to occur more frequently in women The classification of the different subtypes of bipolar disorders is done depending on the severity and frequency of the episodes Other subtypes beside bipolar I and bipolar II disorder are rapid cycling more than episodes of

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesClinical staging is widespread in medicine it informs prognosis clinical course and treatment and assists individualized care Staging places an individual on a probabilistic continuum of increasing potential disease severity ranging from clinically atrisk or latency stage through first threshold episode of illness or recurrence and finally to late or endstage disease The aim of the present paper was to examine and update the evidence regarding staging in bipolar disorder and how this might inform
bipolar disorder,targeted and individualized intervention approachesMethodsWe provide a narrative review of the relevant informationResultsIn bipolar disorder the validity of staging is informed by a range of findings that accompany illness progression including neuroimaging data suggesting incremental volume loss cognitive changes and a declining likelihood of response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments Staging informs the adoption of a number of approaches including the active promotion of both indicated prevention for atrisk individuals and early intervention strategies for
bipolar disorder,newly diagnosed individuals and the tailored implementation of treatments according to the stage of illnessConclusionsThe nature of bipolar disorder implies the presence of an active process of neuroprogression that is considered to be at least partly mediated by inflammation oxidative stress apoptosis and changes in neurogenesis It further supports the concept of neuroprotection in that a diversity of agents have putative effects against these molecular targets Clinically staging suggests that the atrisk state or first
bipolar disorder,Mania in old age is not as rare as it was once thought to be It may constitute up to per cent of admissions in the psychogeriatric department The clinical picture for the most part seems to correspond with mania in younger patients although some patients may have atypical presentations Secondary mania should be excluded first before a firm diagnosis of primary affective disorder is made The prognosis and treatment of late onset mania do
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveBipolar affective disorder runs a natural course of frequent relapses and recurrences Despite significant strides in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder most bipolar patients cannot be treated only by drugs The limitations of using medication alone in symptomatic relapse prevention and satisfactionquality of life terms have long prompted interest in wider forms of management One of the promising way how to enhance remission seems to be combination of pharmacotherapy and psychoeducationMethodsStudies were identified through

bipolar disorder,The debate regarding the possible existence of prepubertal bipolar illness has surfaced at various points in history In its most recent incarnation proponents of a childhood bipolar diagnosis argue that there is an earlyonset form of bipolar illness that is highly comorbid and characterized by simultaneous irritability and depression Others have suggested that childhood manic symptoms are more likely a nonspecific indicator of risk or may be the result of symptom overlap with various other

bipolar disorder,Borderline personality disorder BPD and bipolar disorder types I and II are frequently confused because of their symptomatic overlap Although affective instability is a prominent feature of each the pattern is entirely different BPD is characterized by transient mood shifts that occur in response to interpersonal stressors whereas bipolar disorder is associated with sustained mood changes These disorders can be further distinguished by comparing their phenomenology etiology family history biological studies outcome and response to
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a pathological disturbance of mood characterized by waxing and waning manic depressive and sometimes distinctly mixed states A diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made with certainty when the manic syndrome declares itself Most individuals who are diagnosed with this disorder will experience both poles of the illness recurrently but depressive episodes are the commonest cause of morbidity and indeed of death by suicide Twin adoption and epidemiological studies suggest a
bipolar disorder,strongly genetic aetiology It is a genetically and phenotypically complex disorder Thus the genes contributing are likely to be numerous and of small effect Individuals with bipolar disorder also display deficits on a range of neuropsychological tasks in both the acute and euthymic phases of illness and correlations between number of affective episodes experienced and task performance are commonly reported Current selfreport and observerrated scales are optimized for unipolar depression and hence limited in their

bipolar disorder,Early onset pediatric bipolar disorders are still an issue of much controversy due to several clinical particularities of the thymic episodes at this age To date there is indeed no consensus regarding the prevalence of bipolar disorders before puberty Diagnosis criteria in children and young adolescents remain thus elusive The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of this issue The idea of continuity from childhood to adulthood in bipolar disorders also raises
bipolar disorder,ObjectivesEarly intervention and preventive strategies have become major targets of research and service development in psychiatry over the last few years Compared to schizophrenia bipolar disorder BD has received limited attention in this regard In this paper we review the available literature in order to explore the public health significance of BD and the extent to which this may justify the development of early intervention strategies for this disorderMethodsThe main computerized psychiatric literature databases were
bipolar disorder,accessed This included Medline and PsychInfo using the following keywords bipolar early intervention staging model burden caregiver public health and manic depressionResultsBD is often recurrent and has an impact that goes well beyond symptomatic pathology The burden it incurs is linked not only to its cardinal clinical features but also to cognitive dysfunction poor functional outcome poor physical health high rate of comorbidities and suicide At a societal level BD induces enormous direct and indirect
bipolar disorder,costs and has a major impact on caregivers The available literature reveals a usually long delay between illness onset and the start of treatment and the absence of specific guidelines for the treatment of the early phase of BDConclusionsConsidering the major impact of BD on patients and society there is an urgent need for the development of early intervention strategies aimed at earlier detection and more specific treatment of the early phase of the disorder
bipolar disorder,Growing evidence indicates that risk for bipolar disorder is characterized by elevated activation in a frontostriatal reward neural circuit involving the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex among other regions It is proposed that individuals with abnormally elevated rewardrelated neural activation are at risk for experiencing an excessive increase in approachrelated motivation during life events involving rewards or goal striving and attainment In the extreme this increase in motivation is reflected in hypomanicmanic symptoms By contrast
bipolar disorder,unipolar depression without a history of hypomaniamania is characterized by decreased reward responsivity and decreased rewardrelated neural activation Collectively this suggests that risk for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression are characterized by distinct and opposite profiles of reward processing and rewardrelated neural activation The objective of the present paper is threefold First we review the literature on reward processing and rewardrelated neural activation in bipolar disorder and in particular risk for hypomaniamania Second we propose
bipolar disorder,In treating bipolar disorder specific psychotherapies in adjunct to pharmacotherapy have been shown to be effective in preventing new episodes and treating depressive episodes Among those interpersonal and social rhythm therapy IPSRT developed by Frank amalgamation of interpersonal psychotherapy IPT with behavioral therapy focused on social rhythm has been shown to be an efficacious adjunct to mediation in preventing new episodes in bipolar I patients and in treating depression in bipolar I arid II disorder

bipolar disorder,The concept of prevention is not new to psychiatry and has long been recognized in general medicine Recent evidence has highlighted that early pharmacological and psychosocial treatment dramatically ameliorates poor prognosis and outcome for individuals with psychotic disorders reducing conversion rates to fullblown illness and decreasing symptom severity Nevertheless despite the many recent advances in our thinking about early intervention the need for early intervention in bipolar disorder BPD is an area that has been
bipolar disorder,relatively neglected This review attempts to synthesize what is currently known about early intervention in BPD We discuss methodological issues pertaining to this topic review clinical studies that focus on highrisk subjects as well as firstepisode patients and review findings from brain imaging studies in the offspring of individuals with BPD as well as in firstepisode patients A companion paper discusses the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of agents with neurotrophic and neuroplastic properties
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often devastating illness that may go undiagnosed because of its complex and diverse presentation Clinicians can provide psychological treatments in conjunction with pharmacotherapy that can reduce the frequency severity and duration of manic and depressive episodes Because bipolar disorder is characterized by high degrees of comorbidity and high rates of medical complications the clinician will frequently need to implement other treatments targeted to comorbid conditions such as panic generalized

bipolar disorder,IntroductionThe diagnostic boundaries between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are controversial due to the ambiguity of psychiatric nosology From this perspective it is noteworthy that formal thought disorder has historically been considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia Given that human thought is partially based on language we can hypothesize that alterations in language may help differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorderMethodIn this exploratory study we employed natural language processing techniques to identify differences in language abnormalities between patients
bipolar disorder,with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder The KoBERT and KoGPT language models were used to determine sentence acceptability assessing how natural and therefore acceptable a given sentence is to the general population In addition semantic word networks were constructed for each group and network measures were comparedResultsPatients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder used less acceptable sentences than controlsPost hocanalysis revealed that the schizophrenia group used less acceptable sentences than the bipolar disorder group Furthermore the semantic
bipolar disorder,word networks of the three groups were significantly different in the three network measuresPost hocanalysis revealed a significant difference between the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder networks The bipolar disorder network generally fell between the schizophrenia and control networks except in terms of the average clustering coefficientConclusionsPatients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed significant differences in sentence acceptability as calculated by the language model as well as in the network metrics estimated by semantic network analysis

bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a recurrent highly disabling underrecognized and undertreated disease Our view upon bipolar disorder changed paradigmatically from a disorder formerly seen as a rather benign disease as compared to schizophrenia to a disease with inherent cognitive psychosocial and emotional disabilities going along with high suiciderates and high rates of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities The concept of a bipolar spectrum as represented by Jules Angst and Hagop Akiskal challenges current operationalized diagnostic criteria as
bipolar disorder,IntroductionSeveral studies have been carried out regarding the possible overlap between Bipolar Disorder and borderline personality disorder Up to now it is not possible to provide a definitive picture In fact there is currently significant debate about the relationship between Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar DisorderMethodsMEDLINE searches were performed to identify the latest studies of these disorders considering psychodynamic aspectsDiscussionBipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder share common clinical features namely affective instability and impulsivity which
bipolar disorder,Recent suggestions to extend the boundaries of bipolar disorder to a broader spectrum lead to a concept of bipolarity different from that of classical psychiatry It has been proposed that many patients with unipolar depression are actually bipolar and that many cases of substance abuse personality disorders and childhood behavioral disorders lie within the spectrum However since this expanded notion of bipolarity has been defined entirely on the basis of phenomenology any expansion needs to
bipolar disorder,Lithium has long been considered as less than ideal in the management of rapid cycling and mixed states in bipolar disorder However these forms of bipolarity represent a generally more difficult phase of the illness to treat with any medication Increasing knowledge about lithiums other beneficial effects including protection against suicide and neuromodulatory effects which may protect the brain make it a firstline treatment for any form of bipolar disorder As newer therapies become available
bipolar disorder,A review of two centuries literature on the natural history of bipolar disorder including modern naturalistic studies and new data from a lifelong followup study of bipolar patients reaches the following conclusions the findings of modern followup studies are closely compatible with those of studies conducted before the introduction of modern antidepressant and moodstabilizing treatments Bipolar disorder has always been highly recurrent and considered to have a poor prognosis Bipolar patients who have been hospitalized
bipolar disorder,spend about of their lifetime from the onset of their disorder in episodes Fifty percent of bipolar episodes last between and months median months The intervals between the first few episodes tend to shorten later the episodes return at an irregular rhythm of about episodes per year with high interindividual variability Switches from mania into mild depression and from depression into hypomania were frequently reported in the 19th century and the first half of the
bipolar disorder,20th Antidepressant and antimanic drugs have to be given as long as the natural episode lasts Given the poor outcome of bipolar disorders found in naturalistic followup studies and our lifelong investigation intensive antidepressant antimanic and moodstabilizing treatments are required in most cases Despite modern treatments the outcome into old age is still poor full recovery without further episodes rare recurrence of episodes with incomplete remission the rule and the development of chronicity and suicide
bipolar disorder,A new paradigm of the bipolar spectrum is shaping up in the research literature and in clinical practice It represents a partial return to the Kraepelinian broad concept of manic depression which included many recurrent depressions Although bipolar I and bipolar II are now part of the official nomenclature of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV the breadth of bipolarity is not represented in this manual Old and new evidence indicate
bipolar disorder,that the most common form of bipolar II is characterized by hypomanias of shorter duration than the arbitrary threshold of four days and that cyclothymic depressions represent a prevalent variant of the bipolar II pattern Furthermore evidence is now compelling that hypomania in association with antidepressant treatments requires familial bipolar diathesis for bipolar disorder bipolar III There also exist clinical depressions superimposed on hyperthymic temperament bipolar IV referring to individuals with subthreshold hypomanic traits rather
bipolar disorder,than episodes Given emerging data for a population prevalence of at least for a broadly conceived bipolar spectrumand for the cyclothymic temperamentthe author submits that one of ten individuals in the community either has bipolar disorder or is at risk for it These are probably conservative estimates because the range of clinical phenotypes and that of temperaments at risk are expanding A provocative development is the emergence of extensive clinical and research evidence for the
bipolar disorder,comorbidity of panic social phobia and related anxiety states with bipolar and especially bipolar II disorder In addition prevalent mixed states beyond dysphoric mania have been described consisting of hypomanic intrusions into major depressive statesThe net effect of the broadened boundaries of bipolarity is encroachment into the terrain of socalled unipolar anxiousdepressions and of axis II cluster B This is an evolving reformulation of the subclassification of affective disorders reviewed in this article validated on

bipolar disorder,Further understanding of older age bipolar disorder OABD may lead to more specific recommendations for treatment adjusted to the specific characteristics and needs caused by agerelated somatic and cognitive changes Lateonset mania has a broad differential diagnosis and requires full psychiatric and somatic workup including brain imaging Research on pharmacotherapy in OABD is limited Firstline treatment of OABD is similar to that for adult bipolar disorder BD with specific attention to vulnerability to side effects
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BPD is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment Over the past decades BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis phenomenology and treatment of paediatric
bipolar disorder,BPD The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity Therefore longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD Given high rates of genetic predisposition for BPD assessment of youth should focus on obtaining accurate family history of this condition Additionally there has been a substantial increase in randomised
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum particularly among unaffected firstdegree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits This suggests a model in which large doses
bipolar disorder,of risk variants cause illness but mild to moderate doses confer advantages which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population Bipolar disorder may thus be better conceptualized as a dimensional trait existing at the extreme of normal population variation in positive temperament personality and cognitive traits aspects of which may reflect a shared vulnerability with creativity Investigations of this shared vulnerability may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying illness and suggest novel treatments
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by depressive manic and mixed episodes The illness affects about of the population Bipolar I disorders affect both genders equally whereas bipolar II disorders seem to occur more frequently in women The classification of the different subtypes of bipolar disorders is done depending on the severity and frequency of the episodes Other subtypes beside bipolar I and bipolar II disorder are rapid cycling more than episodes of

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesClinical staging is widespread in medicine it informs prognosis clinical course and treatment and assists individualized care Staging places an individual on a probabilistic continuum of increasing potential disease severity ranging from clinically atrisk or latency stage through first threshold episode of illness or recurrence and finally to late or endstage disease The aim of the present paper was to examine and update the evidence regarding staging in bipolar disorder and how this might inform
bipolar disorder,targeted and individualized intervention approachesMethodsWe provide a narrative review of the relevant informationResultsIn bipolar disorder the validity of staging is informed by a range of findings that accompany illness progression including neuroimaging data suggesting incremental volume loss cognitive changes and a declining likelihood of response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments Staging informs the adoption of a number of approaches including the active promotion of both indicated prevention for atrisk individuals and early intervention strategies for
bipolar disorder,newly diagnosed individuals and the tailored implementation of treatments according to the stage of illnessConclusionsThe nature of bipolar disorder implies the presence of an active process of neuroprogression that is considered to be at least partly mediated by inflammation oxidative stress apoptosis and changes in neurogenesis It further supports the concept of neuroprotection in that a diversity of agents have putative effects against these molecular targets Clinically staging suggests that the atrisk state or first

bipolar disorder,BackgroundBipolar disorder heterogeneity is large leading to difficulties in identifying neuropathophysiological and etiological mechanisms and hindering the formation of clinically homogeneous patient groups in clinical trials Identifying markers of clinically more homogeneous groups would help disentangle BD heterogeneity Neuroimaging may aid in identifying such groups by highlighting specific biomarkers of BD subtypes or clinical dimensionsMethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of the neuroimaging literature assessing biomarkers of relevant BD phenotypes typeI vs II presence vs

bipolar disorder,Recent suggestions to extend the boundaries of bipolar disorder to a broader spectrum lead to a concept of bipolarity different from that of classical psychiatry It has been proposed that many patients with unipolar depression are actually bipolar and that many cases of substance abuse personality disorders and childhood behavioral disorders lie within the spectrum However since this expanded notion of bipolarity has been defined entirely on the basis of phenomenology any expansion needs to

bipolar disorder,A review of two centuries literature on the natural history of bipolar disorder including modern naturalistic studies and new data from a lifelong followup study of bipolar patients reaches the following conclusions the findings of modern followup studies are closely compatible with those of studies conducted before the introduction of modern antidepressant and moodstabilizing treatments Bipolar disorder has always been highly recurrent and considered to have a poor prognosis Bipolar patients who have been hospitalized

bipolar disorder,A new paradigm of the bipolar spectrum is shaping up in the research literature and in clinical practice It represents a partial return to the Kraepelinian broad concept of manic depression which included many recurrent depressions Although bipolar I and bipolar II are now part of the official nomenclature of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV the breadth of bipolarity is not represented in this manual Old and new evidence indicate
bipolar disorder,that the most common form of bipolar II is characterized by hypomanias of shorter duration than the arbitrary threshold of four days and that cyclothymic depressions represent a prevalent variant of the bipolar II pattern Furthermore evidence is now compelling that hypomania in association with antidepressant treatments requires familial bipolar diathesis for bipolar disorder bipolar III There also exist clinical depressions superimposed on hyperthymic temperament bipolar IV referring to individuals with subthreshold hypomanic traits rather

anxiety disorder,The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition DSM categorization of mental disorders places separation anxiety disorder within the broad group of anxiety disorders and its diagnosis no longer rests on establishing an onset during childhood or adolescence In previous editions of DSM it was included within the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence with the requirement for an onset of symptoms before the age of years symptomatic adults could
anxiety disorder,only receive a retrospective diagnosis based on establishing this early onset The new position of separation anxiety disorder is based upon the findings of epidemiological studies that revealed the unexpectedly high prevalence of the condition in adults often in individuals with an onset of symptoms after the teenage years its prominent place within the DSM group of anxiety disorders should encourage further research into its epidemiology etiology and treatment This review examines the clinical features
anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder SAD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with key behavioral traits of social fearfulness social avoidance and submissiveness Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety and so may be important in SAD Hormonal alterations often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors eg genetic predisposition x early trauma predispose to socially fearful avoidant and submissive behavior However whereas gene

anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is a prevalent and highly disabling mental health condition however there is still much to learn with regard to pertinent biomarkers as well as diagnosis made more difficult by the marked and common overlap of GAD with affective and anxiety disorders Recently intensive research efforts have focused on GAD applying neuroimaging genetic and bloodbased approaches toward discovery of pathogenetic and treatmentrelated biomarkers In this paper we review the large amount of
anxiety disorder,available data and we focus in particular on evidence from neuroimaging genetic and neurochemical measurements in GAD in order to better understand potential biomarkers involved in its etiology and treatment Overall the majority of these studies have produced results that are solitary findings sometimes inconsistent and not clearly replicable For these reasons they have not yet been translated into clinical practice Therefore further research efforts are needed to distinguish GAD from other mental disorders and
anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD and panic disorder PD are among the most common mental disorders in the United States and they can negatively impact a patients quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid
anxiety disorder,conditions Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy The GAD and the Severity Measure for Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors andor psychotherapy both of which are highly effective Among psychotherapeutic treatments cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has

anxiety disorder,This review considers recent research assessing psychophysiological reactivity to fear imagery in anxiety disorder patients As in animal subjects fear cues prompt in humans a state of defensive motivation in which autonomic and somatic survival reflexes are markedly enhanced Thus a startle stimulus presented in a fear context yields a stronger potentiated reflex providing a quantitative measure of fearful arousal This fear potentiation is further exaggerated in specific or social phobia individuals when viewing pictures
anxiety disorder,or imagining the phobic object Paradoxically fear imagery studies with more severe anxiety disorder patientspanic disorder with agoraphobia generalized anxiety disorder or anxious patients with comorbid depressionshow a blunted less robust fear potentiated response Furthermore this reflex blunting appears to systematically be more pronounced over the anxiety disorder spectrum coincident with lengthier chronicity worsening clinicianbased judgments of severity and prognosis and increased questionnairebased indices of negative affectivity suggesting that normal defensive reactivity may be compromised
anxiety disorder,Generalized persistent and freefloating anxiety was first described by Freud in The diagnostic term generalized anxiety disorder GAD was not in classification systems until the publication of the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders third edition DSMIII in 1980 Initially considered as a residual category to be used when no other diagnosis could be made it is not accepted that GAD represents a distinct diagnostic category yet Since 1980 revisions to the diagnostic criteria

anxiety disorder,Children and adolescents with GAD suffer from excessive pervasive worries that interfere with social academic and family functioning The comorbidity rate with other anxiety disorders and major depression is high The course tends to be chronic and evidence shows continuity between anxiety disorders in youth and adulthood Individual and group CBT and the incorporation of family anxiety management training have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of childhood GAD No doubleblind placebocontrolled pharmacotherapy trials with adequate
anxiety disorder,ObjectiveThe authors review the empirical data on generalized anxiety disorder a diagnostic category that has been among the more conceptually challenging in psychiatric nosologyMethodPublished studies and recent findings that were considered by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Subcommittee of the DSMIV Anxiety Disorders Work Group are reviewed Among the issues examined are diagnostic reliability comorbidity boundaries with other disorders and clinical featuresResultsA variety of data on the reliability and validity of generalized anxiety disorder have been
anxiety disorder,produced Some authors have suggested that generalized anxiety disorder is better conceptualized as a vulnerability that should be located on axis II and others have recommended that the category be eliminated Although the diagnostic reliability of generalized anxiety disorder is lower than that of other anxiety disorders the features constituting the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder have been found to be reliable An important development has been the determination of a set of somatic
anxiety disorder,symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder that differs substantially from those for other anxiety disorders These findings led to reduction in the number of items in the symptom criterion from in DSMIIIR to six in DSMIV Another substantial revision is greater emphasis on the uncontrollability of worryConclusionsWhereas the data on construct and discriminant validity age at onset course familial transmission and response to treatment generally support the DSMIV definition of generalized anxiety disorder the construct

anxiety disorder,A cognitive model of generalized anxiety disorder GAD is described The model asserts that generalized anxiety is an abnormal worry state In this model GAD results from the usage of worrying as a coping strategy and subsequent negative evaluation of worrying The use of worry as a strategy is supported by positive metabeliefs concerning worry whereas the negative appraisal of worrying worry about worry is linked to negative metabeliefs developed out of previous experience These
anxiety disorder,Selective mutism SM is a relatively rare childhood disorder characterized by a consistent failure to speak in specific settings eg school social situations despite speaking normally in other settings eg at home The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM lists SM among the anxiety disorders This makes sense as the current review of the literature confirms that anxiety is a prominent symptom in many children suffering from this condition
anxiety disorder,Further research on the etiology and treatment of SM also corroborates the conceptualization of SM as an anxiety disorder At the same time critical points can be raised regarding the classification of SM as an anxiety disorder We explore a number of such issues in this review Recommendations for dealing with this diagnostic conundrum are made for psychologists psychiatrists and other mental health workers who face children with SM in clinical practice and directions for

anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder social phobia is a disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a fear of negative evaluation by others Epidemiological studies have shown a high prevalence of the condition in the general population the disorder is more common in women than in men Social anxiety disorder has a typical onset during adolescence and a chronic course remission rarely occurs without therapeutic intervention Comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression and alcoholism commonly occur in patients with
anxiety disorder,preexisting social anxiety disorder and increase the burden of the condition Two subtypes of social anxiety disorder have been identified nongeneralized and generalized the latter form causes greater disability and is more often associated with comorbidity The socioeconomic impact of social anxiety disorder on both sufferers and the community is considerable For a person with social anxiety disorder quality of life is greatly reduced work social and personal relationships are all affected Social anxiety disorder
anxiety disorder,In addition to genetic factors the role of epigenetic and other environmental factors in the promotion of anxiety disorder has attracted much attention in psychiatric research When stress is encountered in the environment the hypothalamuspituitary adrenal system HPA system is activated and cortisol is secreted CRHR gene function is closely related to this response As a result of haplotype analysis of CRHR genes in depression and panic disorder patients it was found that genetic polymorphism
anxiety disorder,of CRHR1 and CRHR2 was related to both disorders It is reported that abused children are more susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorder upon reaching adulthood but there also exist genetic polymorphisms that may moderate this relationship Direct methylation of DNA typically repressing gene expression and modification of chromatin structure complexes of histone proteins and DNA via acetylation typically facilitating gene expression represent epigenetic modifications that are thought to influence behavioral phenotypes For example
anxiety disorder,it is rare that schizophrenia develops in identical twins brought up together in the same environment and thus phenotypic differences cannot be explained simply by genetic polymorphism We also evaluated salivary cortisol and amylase reactivity indices of the HPA system and sympathoadrenal medullary system respectfully after electrical stimulation stress and Trier Social Stress Test TSST administration Here we found differences in the cortisol stress response between electrical stimulation and TSST stressors in contrast to the

anxiety disorder,the onset presentation clinical course and treatment response of anxiety disorders in women are often distinct from that associated with men In addition female reproductive hormone cycle events appear to have a significant influence on anxiety disorder onset course and risk of comorbid conditions throughout a womans life Further investigations concerning the unique features present in women with anxiety disorders are needed and may represent the best strategy to increase identification and optimize treatment interventions

anxiety disorder,With the advent of DSMIII in the USA a new disorder termed generalized anxiety disorder GAD was established separately from panic disorder Because GAD was relegated to a residual category it soon became a confusing diagnosis Although revisions in DSMIIIR removed GAD as a residual category they also complicated the clinical examination necessary to arrive at a GAD diagnosis With the publication of DSMIV GAD has been further refined in an attempt to improve the
anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is defined as an uncontrollable disposition to worry about ones welfare and that of ones immediate kin Associated manifestations include arousal vigilance tension irritability unrestful sleep and gastrointestinal distress There is growing evidence for the lifelong nature of this condition among many of its sufferers This and other evidence reviewed in the present paper provide further support for the thesis that the chronic disposition to worry should probably be classified under
anxiety disorder,constitutional or trait anxiety GAD is best considered an exaggeration of a normal personality disposition that can be named Generalized anxious temperament GAT Despite some overlap with anxiousphobic inhibited and avoidantsensitive temperaments GAT seems to have a distinct profile with altruistic overtones on the other hand GAT is less easily distinguished from harmavoidant and obsessive traits That worrying would increase upon relaxation is not a paradox at all and is understandable in an ethological perspective
anxiety disorder,as subserving the defensive function of being vigilant of ever present yet uncertain external dangersto oneself and ones kinin daytoday living GAT can thus be considered as altruistic anxiety subserving hypothetically the survival of ones extended phenotype in a kin selection paradigm Only when extreme does worrying manifest in a clinical context impairing ones interpersonal life and functioning at work and increasing use of general health care resources Furthermore generalized anxiety appears to predispose to

anxiety disorder,Generalized Anxiety disorder GAD is a widespread psychiatric syndrome involving significant consequences on peoples health However recent data show that this disorder has received little attention when compared to other anxiety disorders A review of the publication on GAD also stated that the majority of research has been conducted on descriptive issues whereas etiological factors received lower rates of publication This may be explained by the fact that changes in the conceptualization of GAD slowed
anxiety disorder,down the progression of researches focussing on the identification of factors implicated in the development and the maintenance of its symptoms For example in the third version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders DSM published in 1980 GAD could only be assigned if patients had a persistent anxiety without reporting specific symptoms of other anxiety disorders eg Specific Phobias Panic Disorder ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder With DSM IIIR and DSM IV excessive worry became
anxiety disorder,the central feature of GAD which increased its diagnostic validity Taking that into account where do we stand in the comprehension of GAD What are the etiological factors identified as playing a role in the development and the maintenance of GAD and its central feature excessive and uncontrollable worry The goal of this article consists to provide answers to these questions by reviewing the literature of the current knowledge of GAD and examining various theories
anxiety disorder,and explanatory models available Firstly many studies suggest that environmental factors are implicated in the development and maintenance of GAD However the majority of researches rests on an outofdate conceptualization of GAD Furthermore the nature of experimental designs used in researches limits their conclusion The first environmental factor documented is negative life events Researchers noted that the occurrence of one or more negative life events being significant and appearing in an unexpected way was associated
anxiety disorder,with an increase in the risk to develop a GAD eg Familial problems eg conflicts abuses considered as chronic stressinducing situations have also been suggested as etiological factor of GAD Among the other environmental factors identified are separation during childhood role inversion during childhood lack of social interactions poor life satisfaction and modeling of a relative having an anxiety disorder The cognitive and behavioral approach has been widely used during the last two decades to
anxiety disorder,precise the etiology of GAD First of all some studies have pointed out the function of worry which is to suppress images associated with negative thoughts eg Thus GAD patients seem to develop excessive worries in order to prevent more negative feeling associated with the images of a thought Other authors suggested that a deficit of attention might be responsible of excessive worry Finally some cognitive variables such as intolerance of uncertainty false beliefs about
anxiety disorder,worry negative problem orientation and cognitive avoidance have been suggested as playing a determinant role in the development and maintenance of GAD In order to resume the empirical findings available in the literature an etiological model gathering the cognitive behavioral and environmental factors implicated in GAD is proposed This model suggests that GAD is the result of a psychological vulnerability activated by a tension resulting from a negative event Finally recommendations are brought concerning future

post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood
post-traumatic stress disorder,biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine

post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual
post-traumatic stress disorder,aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as
post-traumatic stress disorder,well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding

post-traumatic stress disorder,main validated risk factors for PTSD were also relevant in the development of PTSDPP including past traumatic history childhood trauma and feeling of helplessness during the traumatic event Criticizing the methodological heterogeneity through studies the observational approach brought out the lack of clinical pertinence of the DSM5A criteria defining the traumatic event for PTSD This criteriology failed to consider the subjective dimension of the threat to psychological integrity generated by a psychotrauma Historical case studies
post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence
post-traumatic stress disorder,intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a
post-traumatic stress disorder,nonconsensual clinical entity from a likely epistemological slip of the definition of psychotrauma the consideration of potential PTSDPP presents an undoubted clinical relevance Indeed it could help practioners to precise the semiological analysis of patients recovering from an acute psychotic episode to impact the prognosis of psychosis thinking about impairment on the quality of life and the affective and suicidal comorbidities and to modify the therapeutic approach in the recovery of schizophrenia In addition the

post-traumatic stress disorder,to global locations of political instability armed civil conflict or natural disasters for the purposes of peacekeeping humanitarian aid or war This review also included parents living with posttraumatic stress disorder who speak specifically about the experience of their children Situations of homeland conflict were excluded The military families of interest are those with one or more parent with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder associated with military service Traumatic experiences leading to posttraumatic stress
post-traumatic stress disorder,disorder can be acquired prior to military service or through unrelated experiences so it cannot be presumed that military service or even combat deployment in and of itself causes posttraumatic stress disorder This review includes the experiences of children currently in childhood as well as adult children of a parent with current or previous military serviceMethodsThe following databases were first searched in August 2016 and updated in January 2020 MEDLINE Embase Web of Science Core

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is a multifaceted syndrome due to its complex pathophysiology Signals of illness include alterations in genes proteins cells tissues and organismlevel physiological modifications Specificity of sensitivity to PTSD suggests that response to trauma depend on gender and type of adverse event being experienced Individuals diagnosed with PTSD represent a heterogeneous group as evidenced by differences in symptoms course and response to treatment It is clear that the biochemical mechanisms involved in
post-traumatic stress disorder,PTSD need to be elucidated to identify specific biomarkers A brief review of the recent literature in Pubmed was made to explore the major biochemical mechanisms involved in PTSD and the methodologies applied in the assessment of the disease PTSD shows preexposure vulnerability factors in addition to traumainduced alterations The disease was found to be associated with dysfunctions of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis HPA and hypothalamuspituitarythyroid axis Sympathetic nervous system SNS activity play a role in

post-traumatic stress disorder,Regrettably exposure to trauma is common worldwide and can have serious adverse psychological results The introduction of the notion of posttraumatic stress disorder has led to increasing medicalisation of the problem This awareness has helped popular acceptance of the reality of posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae which has boosted research into the pathogenesis of the disorder leading to improved pharmacological and psychological management The subjective experience of trauma and subsequent expression of symptoms vary considerably over space
post-traumatic stress disorder,and time and we emphasise that not all psychological distress or psychiatric disorders after trauma should be termed posttraumatic stress disorder There are limits to the medicalisation of distress and there is value in focusing on adaptive coping during and after traumas Striking a balance between a focus on heroism and resilience versus victimhood and pathological change is a crucial and constant issue after trauma for both clinicians and society In this Review we discuss

post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood
post-traumatic stress disorder,biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine
post-traumatic stress disorder,findings that suggest possible mechanisms of inflammation in this disorder in terms of two different but interrelated perspectives putative causes of increased proinflammatory activities and potential consequences that inflammation generates Given that there is currently a dearth of treatment options for PTSD possibilities of new therapeutic approaches using pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatmentsinterventions that have antiinflammatory effects are also discussed Despite the increasing attention given to the inflammatory pathology of PTSD there remains much to be

post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual
post-traumatic stress disorder,aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as
post-traumatic stress disorder,well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding

post-traumatic stress disorder,BackgroundThe update of the PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 emphasizes the definition of psychological traumatism as an objective and external event Nevertheless the scientific debate about the criteriology of PTSD its clinical pertinence for application and the role of subjective dimension appears still open Although the relation between psychotrauma and psychosis has been well examined in the way of trauma as a
post-traumatic stress disorder,risk factor for the development of schizophrenia the potential traumatism represented by the psychotic experience seems to be less knownObjectiveThis paper aims to provide a state of the art about the PTSD in reaction to psychosis defined as PTSD post psychosis PTSDPP particularly in epidemiological and psychopathological termsMethodsWe performed a bibliographic research on Pubmed using the keywords posttraumatic stress disorder psychological trauma schizophrenia review psychosis first episode psychosis recovery schizophrenia with a first screening on
post-traumatic stress disorder,titles and abstracts An acute psychotic episode referred to a decompensation of any pathology of the DSM5schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders or to a mood disorder with psychotic features The articles exclusively interested in the traumatic impact of hospitalizations and treatment conditions were excludedResultsThe literature noted that PTSDPP affected about a quarter to a third of the psychotic patients interrogated during the recovery of an acute psychotic episode The analytic epidemiology showed that the
post-traumatic stress disorder,main validated risk factors for PTSD were also relevant in the development of PTSDPP including past traumatic history childhood trauma and feeling of helplessness during the traumatic event Criticizing the methodological heterogeneity through studies the observational approach brought out the lack of clinical pertinence of the DSM5A criteria defining the traumatic event for PTSD This criteriology failed to consider the subjective dimension of the threat to psychological integrity generated by a psychotrauma Historical case studies
post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence
post-traumatic stress disorder,intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a
post-traumatic stress disorder,nonconsensual clinical entity from a likely epistemological slip of the definition of psychotrauma the consideration of potential PTSDPP presents an undoubted clinical relevance Indeed it could help practioners to precise the semiological analysis of patients recovering from an acute psychotic episode to impact the prognosis of psychosis thinking about impairment on the quality of life and the affective and suicidal comorbidities and to modify the therapeutic approach in the recovery of schizophrenia In addition the

schizophrenia,Epigenetic modifications are increasingly recognized to play a role in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders with developmental origins Here we summarize clinical and preclinical findings of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and relevant disease models and discuss their putative origin Recent findings suggest that certain schizophrenia risk loci can influence stochastic variation in gene expression through epigenetic processes highlighting the intricate interaction between genetic and epigenetic control of neurodevelopmental trajectories In

schizophrenia,BackgroundThe primary rationale for early detection and intervention in schizophrenia is the disorders severity chronicity and treatment resistance This suggests that researchers pay closer attention to schizophrenias premorbid and onset phases when the vulnerability to psychosis becomes expressed and the neurobiological deficit processes driving symptom formation appear to be the most activeMethodWe review the evidence that brain plasticity may be retained or reversed despite deficit processesResultsThe data are preliminary but suggestive enough to warrant further
schizophrenia,The purpose of this study is to verify whether an increasing degree of alexithymia correlates with a prevalence of negative over positive symptoms The framework of the research is phenomenologically oriented conception of the illnesscoping vulnerability paradigm Schizophrenic basic symptoms as markers of schizotropic process activity were assessed with the Frankfurter BeschwerdeFragebogen and cognitive features of the personological matrix were investigated using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale Our findings on a sample of longitudinally followed outpatients
schizophrenia,Evolutionary psychiatrists often consider schizophrenia to be an enigma how come natural selection has not yet eliminated the socalled schizophrenia genes if the disorder is fairly common heritable and harmful for the reproductive success of its carriers Usually the answer is that the schizophrenic genotype is subject to some kind of balancing selection the benefits it confers would then outbalance the obvious damage it does However in this paper I will show that the assumptions
schizophrenia,underlying such resolution are at least implausible and sometimes even erroneous First of all I will examine some factual assumptions in particular about schizophrenias impact on reproductive success its genetics its history and its epidemiology Secondly I will take a critical look at a major philosophical assumption in evolutionary psychiatric explanations of schizophrenia Indeed evolutionary psychiatrists take it for granted that schizophrenia is a natural kind ie a bounded and objectively real entity with discrete

schizophrenia,Therapy with classical neuroleptics is not effective enough and its adverse effects are quite disabling especially in chronic or negative schizophrenia that is probably why adjunctive therapy is so common Still conclusive evidence concerning the potential benefit of one or another therapeutic association is scarce Intrinsic heterogeneity of schizophrenias and tremendous methodological problems constitute plausible explanations Besides studies are usually realised among unselected patients Available data about adjunctive therapy with anticholinergics propranolol antidepressants benzodiazepines lithium
schizophrenia,BackgroundSchizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder with multiple putative risk genes and many reports of reduced cortical gray matter Identifying the genetic loci contributing to these structural alterations in schizophrenia and likely also to normal structural gray matter patterns could aid understanding of schizophrenias pathophysiology We used structural parameters as potential intermediate illness markers to investigate genomic factors derived from single nucleotide polymorphism SNP arraysMethodWe used research quality structural magnetic resonance imaging sMRI scans from

schizophrenia,differences from those in schizophrenia or BPAD Although the studies are few and far between nevertheless these point towards the possibility of ATPDs as a distinct entity and underscore the need for pursuing alternate hypothesis such as neuro inflammatory or metabolic Research on ATPDs is limited due to many reasons including lack of harmony between the ICD and DSM diagnostic systems and clinician biases Available research data supports the validity of ATPDs as a distinct

schizophrenia,Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease for over a century its definitions and boundaries have changed over this period and its etiology and pathophysiology remain elusive Despite changing definitions DSMIV schizophrenia is reliably diagnosed has fair validity and conveys useful clinical information Therefore the essence of the broad DSMIV definition of schizophrenia is retained in DSM The clinical manifestations are extremely diverse however with this heterogeneity being poorly explained by

schizophrenia,There has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics of schizophrenia over the past years This has revealed a highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect but with additional contributions from rare copy number and coding variants Many specific genes and loci have been implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic research can proceed These point to disturbances in neuronal and particularly
schizophrenia,synaptic functions that are not confined to a small number of brain regions and circuits Genetic findings have also revealed the nature of schizophrenias close relationship to other conditions particularly bipolar disorder and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders and provided an explanation for how common risk alleles persist in the population in the face of reduced fecundity Current genomic approaches only potentially explain around of heritability but only a small proportion of this is attributable to robustly
schizophrenia,identified loci The extreme polygenicity poses challenges for understanding biological mechanisms The high degree of pleiotropy points to the need for more transdiagnostic research and the shortcomings of current diagnostic criteria as means of delineating biologically distinct strata It also poses challenges for inferring causality in observational and experimental studies in both humans and model systems Finally the Eurocentric bias of genomic studies needs to be rectified to maximise benefits and ensure these are felt

schizophrenia,I begin by examining how genetics drives schizophrenia research and raise both familiar and relatively novel criticisms of the evidence putatively supporting the genetic basis of schizophrenia In particular I call attention to a set of concerns about the effects of placentation on concordance rates of schizophrenia in monozygotic twins which further weakens the case for schizophrenias socalled strong genetic component I then underscore two critical points First I emphasize the importance of taking seriously
schizophrenia,considerations about the complexity of both ontogenesis and the development of hereditary diseases The recognition of developmental constraints and supports is crucial for attention to development exposes the naivete of too many models of gene action in the aetiology of disease Secondly I attend to those schizophreniologists who ignore methodological criticisms and thus presume a genetic basis for schizophrenia and then seek the schizophrenic genotype lacking an adequate phenotype In response I attempt to demonstrate

schizophrenia,Schizophrenia SCZ is a complex mental disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including positive and negative symptoms as well as cognitive impairments Despite the extensive research the underlying neurobiology of SCZ remain elusive To overcome this challenge the use of diverse laboratory modeling techniques encompassing cellular and animal models and innovative approaches like induced pluripotent stem cell iPSCderived neuronal cultures or brain organoids and genetically engineered animal models has been crucial Immortalized cellular models

schizophrenia,sign of disorder and first psychotic symptom In of adult patients who had been admitted with a first schizophrenic episode after age years the prodromal phase in the psychotic prephase began before that age This demonstrates that schizophrenia often begins in an age period in which the social and cognitive development and brain maturation are still unfinished Earlyonset schizophrenias or years were compared with a mediumonset group years and a lateonset group years with regard

schizophrenia,This paper aims to discuss and test the hypothesis raised by FusarPoli FusarPoli P Can neuroimaging prove that schizophrenia is a brain disease A radical hypothesis Medical Hypotheses in press corrected proof that on the basis of the available imaging literature there is no consistent evidence to reject the radical and provocative hypothesis that schizophrenia is not a brain disease To achieve this goal all metaanalyses on fMRI and schizophrenia published during the current decade
schizophrenia,and indexed in Pubmed were summarized as much as some other useful information eg metaanalyses on genetic risk factors Our main conclusion is that the literature fully supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a syndrome not a disease associated with brain abnormalities despite the fact that there is no singular and reductionist pathway from the nosographic entity schizophrenia to its causes This irreducibility is due to the fact that the syndrome has more than one
schizophrenia,dimension eg cognitive psychotic and negative and each of them is related to abnormalities in specific neuronal networks A psychiatric diagnosis is a statistical procedure these dimensions are not identically represented in each diagnosticated case and this explains the existence of more than one pattern of brain abnormalities related to schizophrenia For example chronification is associated with negativism while the first psychotic episode is not in that sense the same person living with schizophrenia may

schizophrenia,Social withdrawal is one of the most relevant negative symptoms of schizophrenia Animal models that mimic schizophrenias symptoms in general and negative symptoms in particular are difficult to develop because of the high complexity of symptoms and neurochemical disturbances that schizophrenia patients display throughout their lives In recent years we have shown that Roman HighAvoidance RHA rats exhibit some phenotypes that are thought to represent positive symptoms cognitiveattentional symptoms as well as some negative symptoms

schizophrenia,was not observed in adolescent RHA rats or female rats of any age The results also show that the adult male rats of both strains had significant decreases in social preference compared to the adolescent male rats Additionally we also show that female adult RHA rats have greater social preference than their male counterparts These results seem to be in line with previous rodent and human studies and add face validity to the RHA rats
schizophrenia,Since 1911 when E Bleuler thought of the socalled latent schizophrenia as the most frequent type of schizophrenia but most seldom diagnosed as such the question whether there exist abortive forms of schizophrenia was discussed again and again so in 1932 by MayerGross who devoted to the uncharacteristic onset of schizophrenia a special chapter in 1938 by Stern socalled borderline neuroses und in 1949 by Hoch and Polatin pseudoneurotic schizophrenias Since the 50s Huber had

schizophrenia,The main reason for the inconsistent findings in schizophrenia research is the lack of diagnostic conformity This has not changed markedly following the introduction of modern operational diagnostic systems Taking schizophrenia as a disease entity or assuming schizophrenia spectrum psychoses to represent a continuum of diseases without any clear dividing lines the results of family and twin studies point to a multifactorial etiology based on a polygenic mode of transmission Further then it has to
schizophrenia,be assumed a familial continuum from schizophrenia to affective psychosis and other spectrum disorders However in family and twin studies based on Leonhards classification there is clearcut evidence that schizophrenic spectrum psychoses have to be divided into clinical and etiological subgroups with a completely different genetic background For example systematic catatonia is for the most part a sporadic disease whereas periodic catatonia aggregates in families in a manner consistent with a major gene effect Further

schizophrenia,Psychoanalyticdynamic studies and Other studies For people with schizophrenia across categories the average size of psychotherapy trial is small but there are notable and important exceptionsConclusionWe reported a practical method for categorising psychotherapy interventions in evaluative studies with applications beyond schizophrenia A move towards consensus on the classification and reporting of psychotherapies is neededClinical implicationsThis classification can aid clinicians clinical practice guideline developers and evidence synthesis experts to recognise and compare the interventions from same
schizophrenia,Schizophrenia genomewide association studies GWAS have identified common SNPs rare copy number variants CNVs and a large polygenic contribution to illness risk but biological mechanisms remain unclear Bioinformatic analyses of significantly associated genetic variants point to a large role for regulatory variants To identify gene expression abnormalities in schizophrenia we generated wholegenome gene expression profiles using microarrays on lymphoblastoid cell lines LCLs from cases and controls Regression analysis identified transcripts differentially expressed by affection status
schizophrenia,at a genomewide false discovery rate FDR of while simultaneously controlling for confounding effects These transcripts represented genes with functions such as neurotransmission gene regulation cell cycle progression differentiation apoptosis microRNA miRNA processing and immunity This functional diversity is consistent with schizophrenias likely significant pathophysiological heterogeneity The overall enrichment of immunerelated genes among those differentially expressed by affection status is consistent with hypothesized immune contributions to schizophrenia risk The observed differential expression of extended major

schizophrenia,Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease for over a century its definitions and boundaries have changed over this period and its etiology and pathophysiology remain elusive Despite changing definitions DSMIV schizophrenia is reliably diagnosed has fair validity and conveys useful clinical information Therefore the essence of the broad DSMIV definition of schizophrenia is retained in DSM The clinical manifestations are extremely diverse however with this heterogeneity being poorly explained by
schizophrenia,the DSMIV clinical subtypes and course specifiers Additionally the boundaries of schizophrenia are imprecisely demarcated from schizoaffective disorder and other diagnostic categories and its special emphasis on Schneiderian firstrank symptoms appears misplaced Changes in the definition of schizophrenia in DSM seek to address these shortcomings and incorporate the new information about the nature of the disorder accumulated over the past two decades Specific changes in its definition include elimination of the classic subtypes addition of
schizophrenia,Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder that is poorly treated with current therapies In this brief review we provide an update regarding the use of animal models to study schizophrenia in an attempt to understand its aetiology and develop novel therapeutic strategies Tremendous progress has been made developing and validating rodent models that replicate the aetiologies brain pathologies and behavioural abnormalities associated with schizophrenia in humans Here models are grouped into categoriesdevelopmental drug induced and
schizophrenia,Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disease that disturbs several cognitive functions such as memory thought perception and volition Schizophrenias biological etiology is multifactorial and is still under investigation Melatonin has been involved in schizophrenia since the first decades of the twentieth century Research into melatonin regarding schizophrenia has followed two different approaches The first approach is related to the use of melatonin as a biological marker The second approach deals with the clinical applications of
schizophrenia,Schizophrenia substantially contributes to the burden of mental disorders Schizophrenias burden and epidemiological estimates in some countries have been published but updated estimates of prevalence incidence and schizophreniarelated disability at the global level are lacking Here we present the data from and critically discuss the Global Burden of Diseases Injuries and Risk Factors Study data focusing on temporal changes in schizophrenias prevalence incidence and disabilityadjusted life years DALYs globally From 1990 to 2019 schizophrenia raw
schizophrenia,prevalence to million incidence to million and DALYs to million increased by over and respectively while agestandardized estimates remained stable globally In countries with high sociodemographic index SDI both prevalence and DALYs increased while in those with low SDI the agestandardized incidence decreased and DALYs remained stable The malefemale ratio of burden of schizophrenia has remained stable in the overall population over the past years ie MF yet decreasing from younger to older age groups
schizophrenia,raw prevalence in females higher than males after age with males having earlier age of onset and females longer life expectancy Results of this work suggest that schizophrenias raw prevalence incidence and burden have been increasing since 1990 Ageadjusted estimates did not reduce Schizophrenia detection in low SDI countries is suboptimal and its preventiontreatment in high SDI countries should be improved considering its increasing prevalence Schizophrenia sex ratio inverts throughout the lifespan suggesting different age
